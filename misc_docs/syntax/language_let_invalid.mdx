summary: "This is the `let binding` for invalid identifier names."
category: "languageconstructs"

`let \""` is used to bind values to names that are invalid in ReScript, including capitalized names, names with special characters, and reserved keywords.

**Warning: ** This escape hatch is almost exclusively used for interop with JavaScript. If you abuse this, many of the compiler guarantees will go away.

### Example

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
let \"ComponentName" = "Header"
let \"min-width" = 640
let \"exception" = true
```

```js
var ComponentName = "Header";
var min$width = 640;
var exception = true;
```

</CodeTab>
