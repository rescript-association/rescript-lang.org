A `string interpolation` is composed of two backticks. It allows Unicode characters and embeddable values and expressions with the `${myValue}` syntax.

### Example

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
let language = "ReScript"

let exclamation = `${language} is pretty cool.
Right?
🎉
`
```

```js
var language = "ReScript";

var exclamation = language + " is pretty cool.\nRight?\n🎉\n";
```

</CodeTab>
