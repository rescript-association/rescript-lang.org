summary: "This is the `@obj` decorator."
category: "decorators"
status: "deprecated"

> Deprecated since compiler version 11.0. It was mainly used to bind to JS param objects with many optional fields, [records with optional fields](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/record#optional-record-fields) are now natively supported.

The `@obj` decorator is used to create functions that return JavaScript objects
with properties that match the function's parameter labels.

### Example

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
@obj
external action: (~name: string, unit) => _ = ""

let helloAction = action(~name="Hello", ())
```

```js
var helloAction = {
  name: "Hello"
};
```

</CodeTab>
