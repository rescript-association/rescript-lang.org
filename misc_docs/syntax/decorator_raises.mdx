> This decorator requires [`reanalyze`](https://github.com/rescript-association/reanalyze), a code analysis tool for ReScript, to be installed. [Click here to read about how you get started with reanalyze.](https://github.com/rescript-association/reanalyze).

`@raises` is picked up by reanalyze's exception analysis, and acknowledges that a function can raise exceptions that are not caught, and suppresses a warning in that case. Callers of the functions are then subjected to the same rule. Example `@raises(Exn)` or `@raises([E1, E2, E3])` for multiple exceptions.
