The `@dead` decorator is for [`reanalyze`](https://github.com/rescript-association/reanalyze), a static analysis tool for ReScript that can do dead code analysis.

`@dead` suppresses reporting on the value/type, but can also be used to force the analysis to consider a value as dead. Typically used to acknowledge cases of dead code you are not planning to address right now, but can be searched easily later.
