summary: "This is the `@dead` decorator."
category: "decorators"

> This decorator requires [`reanalyze`](https://github.com/rescript-association/reanalyze), a code analysis tool for ReScript, to be installed. [Click here to read about how you get started with reanalyze.](https://github.com/rescript-association/reanalyze).

`@dead` is picked up by reanalyze's dead code analysis, and suppresses reporting on the value/type, but can also be used to force the analysis to consider a value as dead. Typically used to acknowledge cases of dead code you are not planning to address right now, but can be searched easily later.
