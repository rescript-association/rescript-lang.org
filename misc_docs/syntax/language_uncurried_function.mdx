ReScript functions are curried by default, however in certain cases you may need an uncurried function. In these cases we add a `.` in the argument list.

When calling uncurried functions, we must also include a `.` in the argument list.

### Example

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
let add = (. x, y) => {
  x + y
}

let withCallback = (cb: (. int) => unit) => {
  cb(. 1)
}
```

```js
function add(x, y) {
  return (x + y) | 0;
}

function withCallback(cb) {
  return cb(1);
}
```

</CodeTab>
