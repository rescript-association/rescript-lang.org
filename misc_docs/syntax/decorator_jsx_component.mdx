**Since 11.1**

The `@jsx.component` decorator is used to annotate functions that are [JSX](/docs/react/latest/elements-and-jsx) components. This is a _generic_ version that's equivalent to the existing `@react.component` for React.

You will need this decorator whenever you want to use JSX component in JSX expressions, with a [generic JSX transform](/docs/manual/latest/jsx#generic-jsx-transform-jsx-beyond-react-experimental) configured.


### Example

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
// Assuming `Preact` is set up and configured as a generic JSX transform.
@jsx.component
let make = (~name) => {
  <button> {Preact.string("Hello " ++ name ++ "!")} </button>
}
```

```js
import * as Preact from "preact";

function Playground(props) {
  return Preact.jsx("button", {
              children: "Hello " + props.name + "!"
            });
}

var make = Playground;
```

</CodeTab>
