## ReasonConf 2018

We recently had our very first [Reason Conf](https://www.reason-conf.com) last
May! Videos are available on
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtFP_Hn5nIbZY4Xi47qfHhw/playlists),
if you haven't seen them yet. In short, it was a massive success; big, belated
  thanks to [@ryyppy](https://twitter.com/ryyppy),
  [@nikgraf](https://twitter.com/nikgraf) and
  [@okonetchnikov](https://twitter.com/okonetchnikov). This is truly a
  conference by the community, for the community.

That being said, we've heard your feedback during the conference loudly and
clearly. This Reason release addresses _most_ of those feedback! Special thanks
to [@anmonteiro](https://twitter.com/anmonteiro90) and
[@iwanKaramazow](https://twitter.com/_iwan_refmt) for many of these fixes.

See the changes
[here](https://github.com/facebook/reason/blob/master/HISTORY.md#332). No
breaking changes; nothing but an avalanche of quality-of-life improvements.
Hopefully you'd notice many subtle tweaks in your day-to-day development.

We've made a new, corresponding [ReasonReact
release](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/blog/2018/08/06/050) too. Get
it while it's hot!

Thank you for your continued support =).
