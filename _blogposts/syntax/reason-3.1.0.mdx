Special shout-out to this version, as it fixes many bugs and comes with some
long awaited features. As always, the changes are in
[HISTORY.md](https://github.com/facebook/reason/blob/master/HISTORY.md#310).
Special highlights:

- New pipe sugar allows inserting argument at arbitrary position: `[1, 2, 3] |>
  map(_, a => a + 1) |> keep(_, a => a === 2)`. Basically ES2030.
- Tired of seeing `[@bs] foo(bar, baz)` for uncurrying? Use the new version to
  refmt your code to automatically format it into `foo(. bar, baz)`!
- Trailing comma for everything, final function body item now formats to a
  trailing semicolon, `let%foo` extension sugar, fixes for comments, JSX, etc.

Get the new version through
[reason-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reason-cli/) and through
BuckleScript's bs-platform 2.2.2. Have fun!
