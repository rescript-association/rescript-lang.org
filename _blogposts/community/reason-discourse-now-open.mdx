Happy belated new year! Our current reasonml Discord has held up well to the
influx of newcomers until now, but it's getting gradually harder for us to go
through every message every day. We've therefore decided to open up a more
permanent communication medium: [Reason Forum](https://reasonml.chat).

We're still on our real-time Discord chat, but the addition of a forum should
alleviate our maintenance a bit, thanks to the deduping of newcomer questions
and turning sync Discord chat into long-term async discussions. We maintain
another permanent medium, [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/reason), but general
discussions and announcements never really belonged there.

You don't have to register a new account; existing Github logins work. Big
thanks to [Brent Vatne](https://twitter.com/notbrent) for helping us set up
everything!

Enjoy, and here's to an even better year for the Reason and BuckleScript
community =)
