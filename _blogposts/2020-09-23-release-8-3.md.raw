title: What's new in ReScript 8.3 (Part 1)
description: |
---

## Introduction

ReScript is a soundly typed language with an optimizing compiler focused on the JS platform. 
It's focused on type safety, performance and JS interop. It used to be called BuckleScript.

[ReScript@8.3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bs-platform/v/8.3.0) is now available for testing, you can try it via

```
npm i bs-platform@8.3.0
```

The changes are listed [here](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/blob/master/Changes.md#83), this is a large release,  and we will go through some highlighted changes.



## Lightweight FFI attributes without `bs.` prefix

In this release, we make the `bs.` prefix optional, this will make the FFI less verbose.

For example, the old externals for `readFileAsUtf8Sync` used to be written like this


```ocaml
external readFileAsUtf8Sync : string -> (_[@bs.as "utf8"]) -> string = "readFileSync" [@@bs.val] [@@bs.module "fs"]
```

It can now be simplified as 
```ocaml
external readFileAsUtf8Sync : string -> (_[@as "utf8"]) -> string = "readFileSync" 
[@@val] [@@module "fs"]
```

Note almost all previous attributes with `bs.xx` can be simplified as `xx` 
with the exception of the following two that don't have abbreviations:

- `bs.send.pipe` : this attribute was deprecated in favor of `bs.send`; you can still use the existing one for backward compatibility.

- `bs.splice` : this attribute was deprecated in favor of `bs.variadic`; you can still use the existing one for 
backward compatibility.


## default import in Es6 support

If you use es6 module output, the default bindings will be compiled properly now:

```ocaml
external input : string -> string = "default" [@@module "hello"]

let a = input "hello"
```

Will now be compiled properly under es6 format as below:

```js
import Hello from "hello";
var a = Hello("hello");
```


## Customized js file extension support

Now user can pick up their js file extension support per module format:

```json
  "package-specs": [{
    "module": "es6",
    "suffix": ".mjs"
  },{
    "module": "commonjs",
    "suffix": ".cjs"
  }],
  
```

## More flexible filename support

To have better integration with other [JS infrastructures](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/issues/4624), 
for example, Next.js/React Native, we allow file names like `404.res`, 
`Button.Android.res` so that it can just be picked up by those tools



## Better type based inference for pattern `let {a,b,c} = value`

Previously, for code like this:

```ocaml
module N = struct 
    type t = {
        x : int 
    }
end

let f (u : N.t) = 
    let {x } = u in x + 1 (* type error *)
```

You will get a type error

```
Error: Unbound record field x
```

However, since the compiler already knows the type of `u`, it is capable of looking up the label `x` properly. 
In this release, we make the original code style work out of the box without a work-around such as adding a module prefix 
like `let {N.x} = ..`

## Build system enhancement 

A lot of work is put in improving the build system, we will expand on this topic in the next post!

Happy Hacking!
