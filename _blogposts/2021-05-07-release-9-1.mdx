## Exciting Improvements in ReScript 9.1

Our recent few releases of ReScript contains [lots of improvements](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/blob/3134392a364b70c9c172aa6c1dbaa1ac6580265d/Changes.md#91), among which are a few standout features we'd like to further promote. Hope you're as excited as we are about these! It goes without saying, our [updated editor plugin](https://forum.rescript-lang.org/t/ann-rescript-vscode-1-1-1-released/1542/3) works with the new releases.

### New NPM Package

We've finally moved from [bs-platform](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bs-platform) to [rescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rescript)!

This is mostly just a long overdue name change; the package's virtually identical. Apart from the renaming of our CLI.

### CLI Cleanup

We took the occasion of the NPM package move to also unify the binaries `bsc`, `bsb` and their various commands into a single `rescript` command:

```sh
❯ rescript -help
Available flags
-v, -version  display version number
-h, -help     display help
Subcommands:
    build
    clean
    format
    convert
    help
Run rescript subcommand -h for more details,
For example:
    rescript build -h
    rescript format -h
The default `rescript` is equivalent to `rescript build` subcommand
```

Here's a table of translation, if you're upgrading your script that is currently using `bsc` and `bsb`:
- `bsc -format myFile.res`: `rescript format myFile.res`
- `bsb`: `rescript build` \*
- `bsb -make-world`: `rescript build -with-deps` \*
- `bsb -w`: `rescript build -w`
- `bsb -w -make-world`: `rescript build -w -with-deps` \*

\* **However**, we've gone even further to improve your experience; in most cases you won't need to invoke `build`, nor `-with-deps` anymore! Not only is `rescript` an alias to `rescript build`, it also smartly detects whether your dependencies are already built; if not, it builds them automatically.

This means that you can ditch your old `-make-world` (now the explicit `-with-deps` flag, for edge-case explicit usages). Just call `rescript` and everything including dependencies will always be built! As performance is our highest priority, we've ensured that such extra detections does not slow down the build.

### Polymorphic Variants for Numbers and Strings

*Drumrolls*
- Poly variants like `#1`, `#42` compile to JavaScript numbers.
- Poly variants like `#hello`, `#world` compile to JavaScript Strings.

This is a feature many of you were probably waiting for. Now you can interop with a JavaScript value that's a limited set of numbers or strings:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
let secret = #42

// optional type annotation, for documentation
type t = [#1 | #3 | #5 ]

// enjoy the pattern matching
let test = (arg: t) => {
  switch arg {
  | #1 | #3 => "hello"
  | #5 => "world"
  }
}
```

```js
var secret = 42;

function test(arg) {
  if (arg === 5) {
    return "world";
  } else {
    return "hello";
  }
}
```

</CodeTab>

But wait, **there's more**. We allow safely coercing these poly variants to `int`s or `string`s even at the ReScript side:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
let test2 = (arg: [#1 | #3 | #5]) => {
  (arg :> int)
}

let test3 = (arg: option<[#1 | #3 | #5]>) => {
  (arg :> option<int>)
}

Js.log(test2(#1))
Js.log(test3(Some(#3)))
```

```js
function test2(arg) {
  return arg;
}

function test3(arg) {
  return arg;
}

console.log(1);
console.log(3);
```

</CodeTab>

As usual, check the output tabs: there's no runtime cost. Time to upgrade some interop!

### Object Cleanup

Our objects had various constraints due to legacy reasons; we've managed to clean them up, and expose the UX that they deserve:

- `Js.t<{"x": int}>` is now simply `{"x": int}`. Existing code using `Js.t` still work; it's now a no-op. Our `rescript format` will also format them away.
- You can now use object type spread:
  ```
  type point2d = {
    "x": float,
    "y": float,
  }
  type point3d = {
    ...point2d,
    "z": float,
  }
  ```

The cleanup also allowed us to unlock very exciting ideas. For example, [this one](https://forum.rescript-lang.org/t/rfc-more-general-type-checking-for-structural-typings/1485).

## What's Next?

First class unicode support! Expect being able to write the following:

```res
let helloUnicode = (x) =>{
  switch x {
  | '❤️' => "ReScript is awesome"
  | 'Σ' => "Math is fun"
  | _ => "Lots of unicode"
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Don't miss our various other improvements in [our changelog](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/blob/3134392a364b70c9c172aa6c1dbaa1ac6580265d/Changes.md#91). As always we try to keep our changes performant, lean and robust. We hope you'll enjoy these.

See you next time!
