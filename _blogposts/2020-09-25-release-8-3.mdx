title: What's new in ReScript 8.3 (Part 1)
description: |
---

## Introduction

ReScript is a soundly typed language with an optimizing compiler focused on the JS platform.
It's focused on type safety, performance and JS interop. It used to be called BuckleScript.

[ReScript@8.3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bs-platform/v/8.3.0) is now available for testing, you can try it via

```
npm i bs-platform@8.3.0
```

The changes are listed [here](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript/blob/master/Changes.md#83), this is a large release,  and we will go through some highlighted changes.



## Lightweight FFI attributes without `bs.` prefix

In this release, we make the `bs.` prefix optional, this will make the FFI less verbose.

For example, the old externals for `readFileAsUtf8Sync` used to be written like this


<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML Syntax"]}>

```res
@bs.val @bs.module("fs")
external readFileAsUtf8Sync: (string, @bs.as("utf8") _) => string = "readFileSync"
```
```reason
[@bs.val] [@bs.module "fs"]
external readFileAsUtf8Sync: (string, [@bs.as "utf8"] _) => string =
  "readFileSync";
```
```ocaml
external readFileAsUtf8Sync : string -> (_[@bs.as "utf8"]) -> string = "readFileSync" [@@bs.val] [@@bs.module "fs"]
```

</CodeTab>

It can now be simplified as

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML Syntax"]}>

```res
@val @module("fs") external readFileAsUtf8Sync: (string, @as("utf8") _) => string = "readFileSync"
```
```reason
[@val] [@module "fs"]
external readFileAsUtf8Sync: (string, [@as "utf8"] _) => string =
  "readFileSync";
```
```ocaml
external readFileAsUtf8Sync : string -> (_[@as "utf8"]) -> string = "readFileSync"
[@@val] [@@module "fs"]
```

</CodeTab>

Note almost all previous attributes with `bs.xx` can be simplified as `xx`
with the exception of the following two that don't have abbreviations:

- `bs.send.pipe` : this attribute was deprecated in favor of `bs.send`; you can still use the existing one for backward compatibility.

- `bs.splice` : this attribute was deprecated in favor of `bs.variadic`; you can still use the existing one for
backward compatibility.


## default import in Es6 support

If you use es6 module output, the default bindings will be compiled properly now:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML Syntax"]}>

```res
@module("hello") external input: string => string = "default"

let a = input("hello")
```
```reason
[@module "hello"] external input: string => string = "default";

let a = input("hello");
```
```ocaml
external input : string -> string = "default" [@@module "hello"]

let a = input "hello"
```

</CodeTab>

Will now be compiled properly under es6 format as below:

```js
import Hello from "hello";
var a = Hello("hello");
```


## Customized js file extension support

Now user can pick up their js file extension support per module format:

```json
  "package-specs": [{
    "module": "es6",
    "suffix": ".mjs"
  },{
    "module": "commonjs",
    "suffix": ".cjs"
  }],

```

## More flexible filename support

To have better integration with other [JS infrastructures](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript/issues/4624),
for example, Next.js/React Native, we allow file names like `404.res`,
`Button.Android.res` so that it can just be picked up by those tools



## Better type based inference for pattern `let {a,b,c} = value`

Previously, for code like this:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML Syntax"]}>

```res
module N = {
  type t = {x: int}
}

let f = (u: N.t) => {
  let {x} = u
  x + 1
} /* type error */
```
```reason
module N = {
  type t = {x: int};
};

let f = (u: N.t) => {
  let {x} = u;
  x + 1;
}; /* type error */
```
```ocaml
module N = struct
    type t = {
        x : int
    }
end

let f (u : N.t) =
    let {x } = u in x + 1 (* type error *)
```

</CodeTab>

You will get a type error

```
Error: Unbound record field x
```

However, since the compiler already knows the type of `u`, it is capable of looking up the label `x` properly.
In this release, we make the original code style work out of the box without a work-around such as adding a module prefix
like `let {N.x} = ..`

## Build system enhancement

A lot of work is put in improving the build system, we will expand on this topic in the next post!

Happy Hacking!
