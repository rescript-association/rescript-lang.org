## Team Update

It has almost been a year since we originally [launched our new ReScript brand](/blog/bucklescript-is-rebranding), and we think it has been a pretty successful journey so far:

- Brand new documentation experience
- Relaunch of `rescript-react` and its new docs
- Release of our re-imagined VSCode & Vim plugins
- New syntax, compiler and build system improvements, including incremental build performance at scale
- Improved interop with polymorphic variants for numbers and strings
- Accessible object system (no need for `Js.t`)
- The release of our new `rescript` npm package and cli to replace `bs-platform`
- Making every part of ReScript fully community owned
- etc.

Stay tuned, this is just the beginning!

### New Roadmap and Release Cycle Plans

We had some thorough discussions about the future of the project and outlined the most important milestones for the next upcoming releases.

**Here's the gist:**

- Two release channels: `stable` and `experimental`
- More predictable release dates and better migration steps
- Better communication and discussion for breaking changes
- Help the community / companies align on major stable versions

The detailed roadmap with all our planned changes (and definition of our release cycle plan) can be found in our [community / roadmap](/community/roadmap) section.

### New Landing Page

After several iterations, we are happy to announce our new [landing page](/).

This is an incredible milestone for the documentation, and will act as a foundation for some cool new future improvements, such as:

- Highlighted Case Studies from production users such as Beop or Rohea
- An interactive playground widget for the headline code examples
- New starter templates and guides

Furthermore, in case you are a **production user of ReScript** and you want to see your company logo highlighted on the landing page, please [open an issue](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-lang.org/issues) and let us know!

Happy hacking.
