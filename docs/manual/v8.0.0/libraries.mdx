# Libraries

ReScript libraries are just like JavaScript libraries: hosted on [NPM](http://npmjs.com).

If you can't find what you're looking for: sometimes **you don't need a wrapper** to use a JS library:

- Most JS data types, such as array and objects, [map over cleanly to ReScript and vice-versa](shared-data-types.md).
- You also have access to the familiar [JS API](api/js).
- You can use a JavaScript library without needing to bind to them first. Check the [`external`](external) page.
