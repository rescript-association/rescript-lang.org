# Blogpost Guide

<Intro>
Here you can find all the information needed to write and publish a new blog post
on rescript-lang.org.
</Intro>

## Requirements

Clone the [rescript-lang.org repo](https://github.com/reason-association/rescript-lang.org) and follow the README instructions to run the local development server.

Open the [localhost:3000/blog](/blog) page to see the blog page.

## Create a new file

Blogposts are located in the `./_blogposts` directory. File name starts with the date to maintain a natural sort order:

```
_blogposts/YYYY-MM-DD-[title].mdx
```

For example, let's create a new file:

```sh
touch _blogposts/2020-01-30-my-new-blog-post.mdx
```

Refresh your browser within [/blog](/blog). You should now see a warning for some malformed frontmatter data. Let's fix this!

## Add Frontmatter Data

Each blogpost requires a certain set of meta information (so called
"frontmatter"), otherwise it can't be displayed in the blog.

Frontmatter is put **on the top of your file**. Here is a fully working example
of all available attributes:

```
---
author: hongbo
co-authors:
  - chenglou
  - ryyppy
date: "2017-10-01"
previewImg:
badge: release
title: Bloomberg announces BuckleScript 1.0
description: |
  some multiline
  description
---
```

- `author`: An author alias as defined in `./data/blog_authors.json`
- `co-authors`: A list of co-author aliases (same aliases allowed as in the `author` field)
- `date`: A **string** date (always make sure to use the `"`, otherwise yaml
  will parse it as a `date`). The date format is `"YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm"`. All blog
  posts are ordered ascending by date.
- `previewImg`: The image shown in the blog overview, which will also be used
  as a link preview image
- `badge`: An additional badge on the blog, on top of the preview image.
  Available values are `release`, `testing`, `preview`, `roadmap`
- `title`: The title of the article (h1 headline)
- `description`: A description, which will be shown in the Featured blog post
  in the blog overview, and also as an introductory text in the blog article

> **For Maintainers:** The implementation for the frontmatter logic can be found in the
`common/BlogFrontmatter.res` module.

## Special `_blogposts/archive` directory

All blog posts that are put into the `_blogposts/archive` directory will be flagged as *archived* and not show up on the blog overview page.

We keep this directory around to hide old blog posts.
