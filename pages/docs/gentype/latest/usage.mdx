# Usage

<Intro>

`genType` operates on two kinds of entities: _types_ and _values_.
Each can be _exported_ from ReScript to JS, or _imported_ into ReScript from JS.
The main annotation is `@genType`, which by default means _export_.

</Intro>

## Export and Import Types

The following exports a function type `callback` to JS:

```res
@genType
type callback = ReactEvent.Mouse.t => unit
```

To instead import a type called `complexNumber` from JS module `MyMath.ts` (or `MyMath.js`), use the `@genType.import` annotation:

```res
@genType.import("./MyMath")
type complexNumber
```

This imported type will be treated as opaque by ReScript.

## Export and Import Values

To export a function `callback` to JS:

```res
@genType
let callback = _ => Js.log("Clicked");
```

To rename the function and export it as `CB` on the JS side, use

```res
@genType
@genType.as("CB")
let callback = _ => Js.log("Clicked");
```

or the more compact

```res
@genType("CB")
let callback = _ => Js.log("Clicked");
```


To import a function `realValue` from JS module `MyMath.ts` (or `MyMath.js`):

```res
@genType.import("./MyMath") /* JS module to import from. */
/* Name and type of the JS value to import. */
external realValue: complexNumber => float = "realValue";
```

> **Note:** With genType < 2.17.0 or bucklescript < 5.0.0, one had to add a line with `@bs.module` and the current file name. See the older [README](https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/blob/v2.16.0/README.md).



Because of the `external` keyword, it's clear from context that this is an import, so you can also just use `@genType` and omit `.import`.

To import a default JS export, use a second argument to `@genType.import` e.g. `@genType.import(("./MyMath", "default"))`.

Similarly, to import a value with a different JS name, use e.g. `@genType.import(("./MyMath", "ValueStartingWithUpperCaseLetter"))`.

To import nested values, e.g. `Some.Nested.value`, use e.g. `@genType.import(("./MyMath", "Some.Nested.value"))`.

## Interface (.resi) and Implementation (.res) files

If both `Foo.resi` and `Foo.res` exist, the annotations are taken from `Foo.resi`. The same happens with local modules: if present, the module type gets precedence.

The behaviour can be overridden by adding annotation `@genType.ignoreInterface` at the top of `Foo.resi`. Use case: expose implementation details to JS but not to ReScript.

## Type Expansion and @genType.opaque

If an exported type `persons` references other types in its definition, those types are also exported by default, as long as they are defined in the same file:

```res
type name = string
type surname = string
type person = {name: name, surname: surname}

@genType
type persons = array<person>;
```

If however you wish to hide from JS the fact that `name` and `surname` are strings, you can do it with the `@genType.opaque` annotation:

```res
@genType.opaque
type name = string

@genType.opaque
type surname = string

type person = {
  name,
  surname,
};

@genType
type persons = array<person>;
```

## Renaming, @genType.as, and object mangling convention.

**NOTE:** Starting from ReScript 7.0.0, `@genType.as` on record fields will be discouraged,
as it incurs a runtime conversion cost. Use a runtime free `@as` instead.

**NOTE:** Starting from ReScript 11.0.0, the object mangling is removed.

By default, entities with a given name are exported/imported with the same name. However, you might wish to change the appearence of the name on the JS side.

For example, to use a reserved keyword `type` as a record field:

```res
@genType
type shipment = {
  date: float,
  @genType.as("type")
  type_: string,
}
```

Object field names follow ReScript's mangling convention:

```
Remove trailing "__" if present.
Otherwise remove leading "_" when followed by an uppercase letter, or keyword.
```

This means that the analogous example with objects is:

```res
@genType
type shipment = {
  "date": float,
  "_type": string,
}
```

or the equivalent ``` "type__": string```.

Functions and function components also follow the mangling convention for labeled arguments:

```res
@genType
let exampleFunction = (~_type) => "type: " ++ _type

@genType
@react.component
let exampleComponent = (~_type) => React.string("type: " ++ _type)
```

It is possible to use `@genType.as` for functions, though this is only maintained for backwards compatibility, and cannot be used on function components:

```res
@genType
let functionWithGenTypeAs =
  (~date: float) => @genType.as("type") (~type_: string) => ...
```

**NOTE:** For technical reasons, it is not possible to use `@genType.as` on the first argument of a function.

## Dependent Projects / Libraries

ReScript dependencies are specified in `bs-dependencies`.
For example, if the dependencies are `"bs-dependencies": ["somelibrary"]` and `somelibrary` contains `Common.res`, this looks up the types of `foo` in the library:

```res
@genType
let z = Common.foo;
```

Scoped packages of the form e.g. `@demo/somelibrary` are also supported.

**NOTE:** The library must have been published with the `.gen.ts` files created by genType.
