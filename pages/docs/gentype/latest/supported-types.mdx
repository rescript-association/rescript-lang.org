# Supported Types

<Intro>

Some types and values in ReScript do not map directly to JavaScript and need to be converted whenever a value crosses the boundary. This document gives an overview on how `genType`'s convertion works on different types.

</Intro>

## Int

ReScript values e.g. `1`, `2`, `3` are unchanged. So they are exported to JS values of type `number`.

## Float

ReScript values e.g. `1.0`, `2.0`, `3.0` are unchanged. So they are exported to JS values of type `number`.

## String

ReScript values e.g. `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"` are unchanged. So they are exported to JS values of type `string`.

## Optionals

ReScript values of type e.g. `option<int>`, such as `None`, `Some(0)`, `Some(1)`, `Some(2)`, are exported to JS values `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `1`, `2`.
The JS values are unboxed, and `null`/`undefined` are conflated.
So the option type is exported to JS type `null` or `undefined` or `number`.

## Nullables

ReScript values of type e.g. `Js.Nullable.t<int>`, such as `Js.Nullable.null`, `Js.Nullable.undefined`, `Js.Nullable.return(0)`, `Js.Nullable.return(1)`, `Js.Nullable.return(2)`, are exported to JS values `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `1`, `2`.
The JS values are identical: there is no conversion unless the argument type needs conversion.

## Records

ReScript record values of type e.g. `{x:int}` such as `{x:0}`, `{x:1}`, `{x:2}`, are exported to JS object values `{x:0}`, `{x:1}`, `{x:2}`. This requires a change of runtime representation from arrays to objects.
So they are exported to JS values of type `{x:number}`.

Since records are immutable by default, their fields will be exported to readonly property types in Flow/TS. Mutable fields are specified in ReScript by e.g. `{mutable mutableField: string}`.

The `@genType.as` annotation can be used to change the name of a field on the JS side of things. So e.g. `{[@genType.as "y"] x:int}` is exported as JS type `{y:int}`.

If one field of the ReScript record has option type, this is exported to an optional JS field. So for example ReScript type `{x: option<int>}` is exported as JS type `{x?: number}`.

## Objects

ReScript object values of type e.g. `{. "x":int}` such as `{"x": 0}`, `{"x": 1}`, `{"x": 2}`, are exported as identical JS object values `{x:0}`, `{x:1}`, `{x:2}`. This requires no conversion. So they are exported to JS values of type `{x:number}`.
A conversion is required only when the type of some field requires conversions.

Since objects are immutable by default, their fields will be exported to readonly property types in Flow/TS. Mutable fields are specified in ReScript by e.g. `{ @set "mutableField": string }`.

It is possible to mix object and option types, so for example the ReScript type `{. "x":int, "y":option<string>}` exports to JS type `{x:number, ?y: string}`, requires no conversion, and allows option pattern matching on the ReScript side.

Object field names follow ReScript's mangling convention (so e.g. `_type` in ReScript represents `type` in JS):

```
Remove trailing "__" if present.
Otherwise remove leading "_" when followed by an uppercase letter, or keyword.
```

## Tuples

ReScript tuple values of type e.g. `(int, string)` are exported as identical JS values of type `[number, string]`. This requires no conversion, unless one of types of the tuple items does.
While the type of ReScript tuples is immutable, there's currently no mature enforcement in TS/Flow, so they're currenty exported to mutable tuples.

## Variants

Ordinary variants (with capitalized cases, e.g. ``` | A | B(int) ```) and polymorphic variants (with a backtick, e.g. ``` | `A | `B(int) ```) are represented in the same way, so there's no difference from the point of view of JavaScript. Polymorphic variants don't have to be capitalized.

Variants can have an *unboxed*, or a *boxed* representation. The unboxed representation is used when there is at most one case with a payload, and that payload has object type; otherwise, a boxed representation is used. Object types are arrays, objects, records and tuples.

Variants without payloads are essentially sequences of identifiers.
E.g. type ``[@genType] type days = | Monday | Tuesday``.
The corresponding JS representation is `"Monday"`, `"Tuesday"`.
Similarly, polymorphic variant type ``[@genType] type days = [ | `Monday | `Tuesday ] `` has the same JS representation.


When at most one variant case has a payload, and if the payload is of object type, e.g.
``` [ | Unnamed | Named({. "name": string, "surname": string}) ] ```
then the representation is unboxed: JS values are e.g. `"Unnamed"` and
`{name: "hello", surname: "world"}`. Similarly for polymorphic variants.
Note that this unboxed representation does not use the label `"Named"` of the variant case with payload, because that value is distinguished from the other payload-less cases by its type: an object.

If there is more than one case with payload, or if the single payload has not type object, a boxed representation is used. The boxed representation has shape ```{tag: "someTag", value: someValue}```.
For example, type ```| A | B(int) | C(string)``` has values such as ```"A"``` and
```{tag: "B", value: 42}``` and ```{tag: "C", value: "hello"}```.
Polymorhphic variants are treated similarly. Notice that payloads for polymorphic variants are always unary: ``` `Pair(int,int) ``` has a single payload of type `(int,int)`. Instead, ordinary variants distinguish between unary ``` Pair((int,int)) ``` and binary ``` Pair(int,int) ``` payloads. All those cases are represented in JS as ```{tag: "Pair", value: [3, 4]}```, and the conversion functions take care of the different ReScript representations.

The `@genType.as` annotation can be used to modify the name emitted for a variant case on the JS side. So e.g. ``` | [@genType.as "Arenamed"] A``` exports ReScript value `` A `` to JS value `"Arenamed"`.
Boolean/integer/float constants can be expressed as ``` | [@genType.as true] True ``` and ``` | [@genType.as 20] Twenty ``` and ``` | [@genType.as 0.5] Half ```. Similarly for polymorphic variants.
The `@genType.as` annotation can also be used on variants with payloads to determine what appears in `{ tag: ... }`.

For more examples, see [Variants.res](https://github.com/reason-association/genType/tree/master/examples/typescript-react-example/src/Variants.res) and [VariantsWithPayload.res](https://github.com/reason-association/genType/tree/master/examples/typescript-react-example/src/VariantsWithPayload.res).

**NOTE:** When exporting/importing values that have polymorphic variant type, you have to use type annotations, and cannot rely on type inference. So instead of ```let monday = `Monday```, use ```let monday : days = `Monday```. The former does not work, as the type checker infers a type without annotations.

## Arrays

Arrays with elements of ReScript type `t` are exported to JS arrays with elements of the corresponding JS type. If a conversion is required, a copy of the array is performed.

Immutable arrays are supported with the additional ReScript library
[ImmutableArray.res/.resi](https://github.com/reason-association/genType/tree/master/examples/typescript-react-example/src/ImmutableArray.resi), which currently needs to be added to your project.
The type `ImmutableArray.t<+'a>` is covariant, and is mapped to readonly array types in TS/Flow. As opposed to TS/Flow, `ImmutableArray.t` does not allow casting in either direction with normal arrays. Instead, a copy must be performed using `fromArray` and `toArray`.

## Functions and Function Components

ReScript functions are exported as JS functions of the corresponding type.
So for example a ReScript function `foo : int => int` is exported as a JS function from numbers to numbers.

If named arguments are present in the ReScript type, they are grouped and exported as JS objects. For example `foo : (~x:int, ~y:int) => int` is exported as a JS function from objects of type `{x:number, y:number}` to numbers.

In case of mixed named and unnamed arguments, consecutive named arguments form separate groups. So e.g. `foo : (int, ~x:int, ~y:int, int, ~z:int) => int` is exported to a JS function of type `(number, {x:number, y:number}, number, {z:number}) => number`.

Function components are exported and imported exactly like normal functions. For example:

```reason
[@genType]
[@react.component]
let make = (~name) => React.string(name);
```

For renaming, named arguments follow ReScript's mangling convention:

```
Remove trailing "__" if present.
Otherwise remove leading "_" when followed by an uppercase letter, or keyword.
```

For example:

```res
@genType
let exampleFunction = (~_type) => "type: " ++ _type
```

## Imported Types

It's possible to import an existing TS/Flow type as an opaque type in ReScript. For example,

```res
@genType.import("./SomeFlowTypes") type weekday
```

defines a type which maps to `weekday` in `SomeFlowTypes.js`.
See for example [Types.res](https://github.com/reason-association/genType/tree/master/examples/flow-react-example/src/Types.res) and [SomeFlowTypes.js](https://github.com/reason-association/genType/tree/master/examples/flow-react-example/src/SomeFlowTypes.js).

## Recursive Types

Recursive types which do not require a conversion are fully supported.
If a recursive type requires a conversion, only a shallow conversion is performed, and a warning comment is included in the output. (The alternative would be to perform an expensive conversion down a data structure of arbitrary size).
See for example [Types.res](https://github.com/reason-association/genType/tree/master/examples/typescript-react-example/src/nested/Types.res).

## First Class Modules

ReScript first class modules are converted from their array ReScript runtime representation to JS Object types.
For example,

```res
module type MT = {
  let x: int
  let y: string
}
module M = {
  let y = "abc"
  let x = 42
}

@genType
let firstClassModule: module(MT) = module(M)
```

is exported as a JS object of type

```res
{"x": number, "y": string}
```

Notice how the order of elements in the exported JS object is determined by the module type `MT` and not the module implementation `M`.

## Polymorphic Types

If a ReScript type contains a type variable, the corresponding value is not converted. In other words, the conversion is the identity function. For example, a ReScript function of type `{payload: 'a} => 'a` must treat the value of the payload as a black box, as a consequence of parametric polymorphism. If a typed back-end is used, the ReScript type is converted to the corresponding generic type.

### Exporting Values from Polymorphic Types with Hidden Type Variables

For cases when a value that contains a hidden type variable needs to be converted, a function can be used to produce the appropriate output:

**Doesn't work**

```res
@genType
let none = None
```

```js
export const none: ?T1 = OptionBS.none; // Errors out as T1 is not defined
```

**Works**

```res
@genType
let none = () => None
```

```js
const none = <T1>(a: T1): ?T1 => OptionBS.none;
```

## Promises

Values of type `Js.Promise.t<arg>` are exported to JS promises of type `Promise<argJS>` where `argJS` is the JS type corresponding to `arg`.
If a conversion for the argument is required, the conversion functions are chained via `.then(promise => ...)`.
