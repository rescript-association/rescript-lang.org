# Lazy Components

<Intro>

It's good practice to delay loading the JavaScript required to render components you're not actually showing yet. This helps with performance and makes your application load faster. 

React ships with an [API for dynamically loading components](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy#lazy). In this little guide we'll show you how to dynamically load React components in ReScript.

</Intro>

> **Note:** This section requires the latest [@rescript/react](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-react) bindings to be installed (_0.12.0-alpha.2 and above_).

ReScript comes with APIs for doing dynamic imports both for single values and for entire modules. These APIs make dynamically importing React components easy.

Let's look at a small example. First we'll define a simple component:

```res example
// Title.res
@react.component
let make = (~text) => {
  <div className="title">{text->React.string}</div>
}
```

Now we can dynamically import the `<Title/>` component by passing the result of our dynamic import to `React.lazy_`:

```rescript
// SomeOtherFile.res
module LazyTitle = {
  let make = React.lazy_(() => import(Title.make))
}

let titleJsx = <LazyTitle text="Hello!" />
```

That's all the code we need! The new `<LazyTitle />` component behaves exactly the same as the wrapped `<Title />` component, but will be lazy loaded via React's built-in lazy mechanism.
