# Installation

**Requirements:**

- `rescript@10.1` or later
- `react@18.0.0` or later

Add following dependency to your ReScript project (in case you don't have any project yet, check out the [installation instructions](/docs/manual/latest/installation) in the manual):

```
npm install @rescript/react
```

Then add the following setting to your existing `bsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "jsx": { "version": 4, "mode": "classic" },
  "bs-dependencies": ["@rescript/react"]
}
```

> The [new jsx transform](https://ko.reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html) of ReactJS is available with `mode: "automatic"`.

**Note** JSX v4 is newly introduced with the idomatic record-based representation of component. If your dependecies are not compatible with v4 yet, then you can use v3 in the same project. Check out the details in [Migrate from v3](/docs/react/latest/migrate-react)

To test your setup, create a new `.res` file in your source directory and add the following code:

```res
// src/Test.res
@react.component
let make = () => {
  <div> {React.string("Hello World")} </div>
}
```

Now run `npx rescript` and you should see a successful build.

## Exposed Modules

After a successful installation, `@rescript/react` will make following modules available in your project's global scope:

- `React`: Bindings to React
- `ReactDOM`: Bindings to the ReactDOM
- `ReactDOMServer`: Bindings to the ReactDOMServer
- `ReactEvent`: Bindings to React's synthetic events
- `ReactDOMStyle`: Bindings to the inline style API
- `RescriptReactRouter`: A simple, yet fully featured router with minimal memory allocations
- `RescriptReactErrorBoundary`: A component which handles errors thrown in its child components gracefully
