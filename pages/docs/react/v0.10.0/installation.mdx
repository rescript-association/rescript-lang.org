# Installation

**Requirements:**

- `rescript >=9.1.2 < 10.0` (alternatively for older codebases: `bs-platform@8.3 or later`)
- `react >=16.8.1 < 18.0.0` or later

Add following dependency to your ReScript project (in case you don't have any project yet, check out the [installation instructions](/docs/manual/latest/installation) in the manual):

```
npm install @rescript/react
```

Then add the following setting to your existing `bsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "reason": { "react-jsx": 3 },
  "bs-dependencies": ["@rescript/react"]
}
```

To test your setup, create a new `.res` file in your source directory and add the following code:

```res
// src/Test.res
@react.component
let make = () => {
  <div> {React.string("Hello World")} </div>
}
```

Now run `npx rescript` and you should see a successful build.

## Exposed Modules

After a successful installation, `@rescript/react` will make following modules available in your project's global scope:

- `React`: Bindings to React
- `ReactDOM`: Bindings to the ReactDOM
- `ReactDOMServer`: Bindings to the ReactDOMServer
- `ReactEvent`: Bindings to React's synthetic events
- `ReactDOMStyle`: Bindings to the inline style API
- `RescriptReactRouter`: A simple, yet fully featured router with minimal memory allocations
