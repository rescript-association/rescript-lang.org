# Migrate from ReasonReact

ReScript-React is mostly feature-compatible with ReasonReact, with a few long deprecated modules now removed:

- `ReactEventRe`: use `ReactEvent`.
- `ReactDOMServerRe`: use `ReactDOMServer`.
- `ReactDOMRe`: use `ReactDOM`.
- `ReasonReact`: use `React`.
- `ReasonReactCompat` fully removed. Was [used](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/reasonreactcompat) to migrate to ReasonReact `0.7.0`.

Reminder: for `ReactDOMRe.renderToElementWithClassName` and `ReactDOMRe.renderToElementWithId`, use `ReactDOM.querySelector` + `ReactDOM.render` if you haven't moved to `ReactDOM` already previously.

Note: to migrate to ReScript-React, you need to be on ReasonReact `>=0.8.0`. If not, please first [upgrade to the latter](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react/blob/master/HISTORY.md#080-042020). Sorry for the trouble.
