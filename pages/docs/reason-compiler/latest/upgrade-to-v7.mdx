# Upgrade Guide to v7

If you have been using BuckleScript for the last couple of years, you probably
noticed that upgrading to the newest version has always been a seamless
experience without any breaking changes or performance loss. That's because the
BuckleScript team puts a lot of effort in making sure users can upgrade as
soon as possible without any changes in their workflow.

That said, this time with the v7 release, there have been some fundamental
compiler changes, which means that upgrades will involve a few more installation
steps than usual (depending on your project setup). Luckily, the upgrade should
still be straight forward and easy to do.

This guide will highlight some of the changes and give you a list of
instructions to upgrade your BuckleScript projects.

> **Note:** You probably noticed that the version number jumped from v5 to v7.
> The v6 version was used for the transition phase, so if you are using v6 right
> now, just upgrade to `bs-platform@7` and you are good to go.

## A Quick Look under the Hood

BuckleScript v7 (and v6) changed the underlying OCaml version from `4.02.3` (BS
v5) to `4.06.1`. Usually this shouldn't impact any existing codebases, unless
they are using PPXes or other meta programming facilities. Simply explained,
PPXes rely on the data representation of the OCaml / Reason syntax (AST), so if
you are using a tool such as `graphql_ppx` (which has usually been compiled
natively with a `4.02.3` OCaml version) you will get a compatibility error when
used with BuckleScript v7.

Luckily during the transition phase between v5 and v7 (which has been an ongoing
process for for several months), the community has been [coordinating
efforts](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/issues/3914) to upgrade
and release commonly used tools to BS v7 compatible compile artifacts. You will
find all installation instructions in this guide as well.


### BS Version Overview / Features

- *BS 5.x and below*: based on OCaml 4.02.3
- *BS 6.x and above*: based on OCaml 4.06.1 (transition version: if in use, upgrade to v7 now)
- *BS 7.x and above*: based on OCaml 4.06.1 (stops 4.02.3 support)
    - Adds [`Inline
      Records`](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/inlinerecords.html)
      support (introduced with `4.03`)
    - Adds the `Records-as-Objects` feature, which makes BS compile record type
      values into JS objects instead of nested arrays (see blog [post 1](//bucklescript.github.io/blog/2019/11/18/whats-new-in-7)
      and [post 2](//bucklescript.github.io/blog/2019/12/27/whats-new-in-7-cont))
    - Ships with `refmt` version `3.5.1` with greatly improved syntax error messages (codename `reerror`)

The biggest upside of upgrading to BS v7, beside enjoying newer language
features, is that we will finally be able to deprecate  underlying OCaml
`4.02.3` code, which will make maintenance way easier (lots of code / processes
can be removed and simplified). Also the OCaml community will greatly benefit
from this change, since a lot of OCaml libraries still have to support a minimum
OCaml version of `4.02.3` just for BuckleScript <= v5 compatibility.

> We recommend upgrading to BS v7 as soon as possible. Your Reason code will
> still work as expected, you'll only need to upgrade your native tools to make
> everything behave correctly.

Please support us moving forward and help us by providing bug reports in case
you have any issues.

## How to upgrade to v7

### Dependencies

**Note:** During the migration phase, some projects / repositories have changed
owners or GitHub organizations to make it easier for us to upgrade build
artifacts in the future. If you are using a PPX we are not aware of, please [let us
know in this issue](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/issues/3914).

#### Upgrade your bs-platform dependency:

- `npm install bs-platform@7 --dev`

#### Upgrade any PPX dependencies you're using:

[`graphql_ppx`](https://github.com/mhallin/graphql_ppx) ->
[`graphql_ppx_re`](https://github.com/baransu/graphql_ppx_re):
  - Remove the [deprecated `graphql_ppx` (by
      mhallin)](https://github.com/mhallin/graphql_ppx): `npm remove
  graphql_ppx`
  - Add the new one: `npm install @baransu/graphql_ppx_re --save-dev`
  - Update your `ppx-flags`: `"ppx-flags": ["@baransu/graphql_ppx_re/ppx6"]`

[`gentype`](https://github.com/cristianoc/genType):
- `npm install gentype@3 --save-dev`

[`decco`](https://github.com/reasonml-labs/decco):
- `npm install decco@1 --save-dev`

[`bs-let`](https://github.com/reasonml-labs/bs-let):
- `npm install --save-dev bs-let`
- Update your `ppx-flags`: `"ppx-flags": ["bs-let/ppx"]`

[`bs-emotion-ppx`](https://github.com/ahrefs/bs-emotion):
- `npm install bs-emotion-ppx@1 --save-dev`
- Update your `ppx-flags`: `"ppx-flags": ["@ahrefs/bs-emotion-ppx/bin/bs-emotion-ppx"]`

[`bs-log`](https://github.com/MinimaHQ/bs-log)
- Currently WIP and [not done
yet](https://github.com/MinimaHQ/bs-log/issues/10)

[`ppx_bs_css`](https://github.com/astrada/ppx_bs_css):
- No upgrade activity yet, please [let us
know](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/issues/3914) if you are
      using it!

#### Clean & Rebuild your project:
- `npx bsb -clean-world`
- `npx bsb -make-world`
- Your project should now be built and working correctly

#### Fix specific warnings:
- `BuckleScript warning: isWebUri : the external name is inferred from val
  name is unsafe from refactoring when changing value name`
    - This  means that you have `external` bindings ending with `= "";`
      (which will automatically take the name of the binding itself), you
      now need to be explicit with the name. Example:
        ```reason
        /* Before (warning) */
        [@bs.module "valid-url"]
        external isWebUri: string => option(string) = "";

        /* After (fixed the warning) */
        [@bs.module "valid-url"]
        external isWebUri: string => option(string) = "isWebUri";
        ```
- Don't forget to rebuild your project again
  
#### Commit your changes:
- Your `.bs.js` files will very likely change, make sure to commit
  everything to have a clean BS upgrade commit


**Note:** Since this upgrade will change the internal data representation of
records to JS objects, make sure you are not having any Reason code relying on
the previous record-as-array representation. This is a quick reminder that it is
generally discouraged to rely on internal data structures.

### Editor extensions

- [`reason-vscode / reason-language-server`](https://github.com/jaredly/reason-language-server):
  Should just work, especially when upgraded to the newest version
- [`merlin`](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin): Make sure your `ocamlmerlin` binary is
  compiled for `4.06.1` and correctly set in your PATH, other than that it should just work
- [`reasonml-idea-plugin`](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/reasonml-idea-plugin): Upgrade to version `v0.76` or above


## How to upgrade PPXes (for tool maintainers)

### Step 1: Upgrade build dependencies

We recommend using [esy](https://esy.sh) for building your native project, so
all instructions are based on the `esy` workflows. Mostly it's about setting the
OCaml version to 4.06 and rebuild the project accordingly (e.g. in your `package.json`):

```json
"devDependencies": {
    "ocaml": "~4.6.1000",
    "@opam/dune": "*",
}
```

If you are using `migrate-parse-tree`, you might want to drop any AST upgrades
from 4.02 -> 4.06 etc, making the native binary more lightweight. 

**Tip:** If you still want to maintain a `4.02.3` based version (for legacy
reasons), you can alternatively create a `esy.json` / `esy-406.json` file and
use `esy's` [sandboxing
feature](https://esy.sh/docs/en/multiple-sandboxes.html#configure-multiple-sandboxes).

We know that these instructions are very rough, many projects use different
configurations. To give you some inspiration on how to tackle an upgrade, here
is a list of migrations / project setups you might find useful:

- `bs-emotion-ppx`: [Full migration diff by anmonteiro](https://github.com/ahrefs/bs-emotion/commit/d93f35754d2ba3000d5ffa9fe17ae158da6dfc38)
- `graphql_ppx_re`: [package.json with 4.06
  support](https://github.com/baransu/graphql_ppx_re/blob/master/esy.json) //
  [402.json for esy
  sandbox](https://github.com/baransu/graphql_ppx_re/blob/master/402.json)
- `decco`: [package.json for 4.06](https://github.com/reasonml-labs/decco/blob/master/ppx_src/package.json)

### Step 2: Release artifacts and add a proper Note in the README

Make sure to release the newly built binary on npm and make clear which PPX versions are compatible with BS6 / BS5 etc.
For example, this is how `gentype` does it:

```
bs-platform 7.0.0 or higher: use genType 3.2.0 or higher.
bs-platform 6.2.0 or higher: use genType 3.0.0 or higher.
bs-platform 5.2.0 or higher: use genType 2.40.0 or higher.
bs-platform 5.0.x and 5.1.x: use genType 2.17.0 or higher.
```


## Conclusion

We are really excited for the upcoming future of BuckleScript. The v7 release
will make JS interop considerably easier while being completely compatible with
existing codebases.
