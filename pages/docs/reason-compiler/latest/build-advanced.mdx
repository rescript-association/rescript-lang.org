# Build System: Advanced

## Customize Rules (Generators Support)

You might use some pre-processor to generate boilerplate code during development.

**Note**: pre-processors can be classified as two categories:

- System-dependent, which should be delayed until running on user machines.
- System-independent: lex, yacc, m4, re2c, etc, which can be executed any time.

BS has built-in support for [conditional compilation](conditional-compilation.md), which satisfies the first point. This section is about the second point.

An example, where bsb uses [ocamlyacc](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual026.html):

```json
{
  "generators": [
    {
      "name": "ocamlyacc",
      "command": "ocamlyacc $in"
    }
  ],
  "sources": {
    "dir": "src",
    "generators": [
      {
        "name": "ocamlyacc",
        "edge": ["test.ml", "test.mli", ":", "test.mly"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`ocamlyacc` will generate the artifacts `test.ml` and `test.mli` in the same directory than `test.mly`.

**Note**: we highly recommend you to check in the generated files, since this cuts out dependencies like `ocamlyacc` for the end-users.

When developing a project, `bsb` will track the dependencies between `test.ml` and `test.mly` properly. When released as a package, `bsb` will cut such dependency, so that users will only need the generated `test.ml`. To help test such behavior in development mode, users could set it manually:

```json
{
  "cut-generators": true
}
```

This _prevents_ `bsb` from regenerating `test.ml` whenever `test.mly` changes.
