# Attribute (Decorator)

Like many other languages, ReScript allows annotating a piece of code to express extra functionality. Here's an example:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
@inline
let mode = "dev"

let mode2 = mode
```
```js
var mode2 = "dev";
```

</CodeTab>

The `@inline` annotation tells `mode`'s value to be inlined into its usage sites (see output). We call such annotation "attribute" (or "decorator" in JavaScript).

An attribute starts with `@` and goes before the item it annotates. In the above example, it's hooked onto the let binding.

## Usage

> **Note:** In previous versions (< 8.3) all our interop related attributes started with a `bs.` prefix (`bs.module`, `bs.val`). Our formatter will automatically drop them in newer ReScript versions.

You can put an attribute almost anywhere. You can even add extra data to them by using them visually like a function call. Here are a few famous attributes (explained in other sections):

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
@@warning("-27")


@unboxed
type a = Name(string)

@val external message: string = "message"

type student = {
  age: int,
  @as("aria-label") ariaLabel: string,
}

@deprecated
let customDouble = foo => foo * 2

@deprecated("Use SomeOther.customTriple instead")
let customTriple = foo => foo * 3 
```
```js
```

</CodeTab>

1. `@@warning("-27")` is a standalone attribute that annotates the entire file. Those attributes start with `@@`. Here, it carries the data `"-27"`. You can find a full list of all available warnings [here](./warning-numbers).
2. `@unboxed` annotates the type definition.
3. `@val` annotates the `external` statement.
4. `@as("aria-label")` annotates the `ariaLabel` record field.
5. `@deprecated` annotates the `customDouble` expression. This shows a warning while compiling telling consumers to not rely on this method long-term.
6. `@deprecated("Use SomeOther.customTriple instead")` annotates the `customTriple` expression with a string to describe the reason for deprecation.

## Extension Point

There's a second category of attributes, called "extension points" (a remnant term of our early systems):

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
%raw("var a = 1")
```
```js
var a = 1
```

</CodeTab>

Extension points are attributes that don't _annotate_ an item; they _are_ the item. Usually they serve as placeholders for the compiler to implicitly substitute them with another item.

Extension points start with `%`. A standalone extension point (akin to a standalone regular attribute) starts with `%%`.
