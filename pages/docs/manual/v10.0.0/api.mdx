# Overview

ReScript ships 3 modules in its standard library.

- [Js](api/js): bindings for all your familiar JavaScript APIs.
- [Belt](api/belt): extra collections and helpers not available in JavaScript.
- [Dom](api/dom): Dom related types and modules.

Usage heuristics:

- Default to using the `Js` module. Most of the APIs in it are runtime-free and compile down to clean, readable JavaScript, which is our priority.
- For other APIs that aren't available in regular JavaScript (and thus don't exist in our `Js` bindings), use Belt. For example, prefer `Js.Array2` over `Belt.Array`.
- The `Dom` module contains our standardized types used by various userland DOM bindings. Due to the complexity of DOM, we don't mind that you ignore this module and build your application-specific DOM bindings.

**Note**: we do not recommend other userland standard library alternatives (unless it's DOM bindings). These cause confusion and split points for the community.
