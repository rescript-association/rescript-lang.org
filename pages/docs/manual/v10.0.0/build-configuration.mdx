# Configuration

`bsconfig.json` is the single, mandatory build meta file needed for `rescript`.

**The complete configuration schema is [here](./build-configuration-schema)**. We'll _non-exhaustively_ highlight the important parts in prose below.

## name, namespace

`name` is the name of the library, used as its "namespace". You can activate namespacing through `"namespace": true` in your `bsconfig.json`. Namespacing is almost **mandatory**; we haven't turned it on by default yet to preserve backward-compatibility.

**Explanation**: by default, your files, once used as a third-party dependency, are available globally to the consumer. E.g. if you have an `Util.re` and the consumer also has a file of the same name, they will clash. Turning on `namespace` avoids this by wrapping all your own project's files into an extra module layer; instead of a global `Util` module, the consumer will see you as `MyProject.Util`. **The namespacing affects your consumers, not yourself**.

Aka, in ReScript, "namespace" is just a fancy term for an auto-generated module that wraps all your project's files (efficiently and correctly, of course!) for third-party consumption.

We don't do folder-level namespacing for your own project; all your own file names must be unique. This is a constraint that enables several features such as fast search and easier project reorganization.

**Note**: the `bsconfig.json` `name` should be the same as the `package.json` `name`, to avoid confusing corner-cases. However, this means that you can't use a camelCased names such as `MyProject`, since `package.json` and npm forbid you to do so (some file systems are case-insensitive). To have the namespace/module as `MyProject`, write `"name": "my-project"`. ReScript will turn that into the camelCased name correctly.

**Note on custom namespacing**: if for some reason, you need a namespace that is different from what your `name` will produce, you can directly send a string to the `namespace` option. For example, if your package is a binding named `bs-some-thing`, you can use `"namespace": "some-thing"` to get `SomeThing` namespace instead of `BsSomeThing`.

## sources

Your source files need to be specified explicitly (we don't want to accidentally drill down into some unrelated directories). Examples:

```json
{
  "sources": ["src", "examples"]
}
```
```json
{
  "sources": {
    "dir": "src",
    "subdirs": ["page"]
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "sources": [
    "examples",
    {
      "dir": "src",
      "subdirs": true // recursively builds every subdirectory
    }
  ]
}
```

You can mark your directories as dev-only (for e.g. tests). These won't be built and exposed to third-parties, or even to other "dev" directories in the same project:

```json
{
  "sources" : {
    "dir" : "test",
    "type" : "dev"
  }
}
```

You can also explicitly allow which modules can be seen from outside. This feature is especially useful for library authors who want to have a single entry point for their users.   
Here, the file `src/MyMainModule.res` is exposed to outside consumers, while all other files are private.

```json
{
  "sources": {
    "dir": "src",
    "public": ["MyMainModule"]
  },
}
```

## bs-dependencies, bs-dev-dependencies

List of ReScript dependencies. Just like `package.json`'s dependencies, they'll be searched in `node_modules`.

Note that only sources marked with `"type":"dev"` will be able to resolve modules from `bs-dev-dependencies`.

## pinned-dependencies

**Since 8.4**: List of pinned dependencies. A pinned dependency will always be rebuilt whenever you build a toplevel package (e.g. your main app) with `rescript`.

This is useful for working on multiple independent ReScript packages simultaneously. More usage details can be found in our dedicated [pinned dependencies](./build-pinned-dependencies) page.

## external-stdlib

**Since 9.0**: This setting allows depending on an externally built stdlib package (instead of a locally built stdlib runtime). Useful for shipping packages that are only consumed in JS or TS without any dependencies to the ReScript development toolchain.

More details can be found on our [external stdlib](./build-external-stdlib) page.

## reason, refmt (old)

`reason` config is enabled by default. To turn on JSX for [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/), specify:

```json
{
  "reason": {"react-jsx": 3},
  "refmt": 3
}
```

The `refmt` config **should be explicitly specified** as `3`.

## js-post-build

Hook that's invoked every time a file is recompiled. Good for JS build system interop, but please use it **sparingly**. Calling your custom command for every recompiled file slows down your build and worsens the building experience for even third-party users of your lib.

Example:

```json
{
  "js-post-build": {
    "cmd": "/path/to/node ../../postProcessTheFile.js"
  }
}
```

Note that the path resolution for the command (`node` in this case) is done so:

- `/myCommand` is resolved into `/myCommand`
- `package/myCommand` is resolved into `node_modules/package/myCommand`
- `./myCommand` is resolved into `myProjectRoot/myCommand`
- `myCommand` is just called as `myCommand`, aka a globally available executable. But note that ReScript doesn't read into your shell's environment, so if you put e.g. `node`, it won't find it unless you specify an absolute path. Alternatively, add `#!/usr/local/bin/node` to the top of your script to directly call it without prepending `node`.

The command itself is called from inside `lib/bs`.

## package-specs

Output to either CommonJS (the default) or ES6 modules. Example:

```json
{
  "package-specs": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "in-source": true
  }
}
```

- `"module": "es6-global"` resolves `node_modules` using relative paths. Good for development-time usage of ES6 in conjunction with browsers like Safari and Firefox that support ES6 modules today. **No more dev-time bundling**!
- `"in-source": true` generates output alongside source files. If you omit it, it'll generate the artifacts into `lib/js`. The output directory is not configurable otherwise.

This configuration only applies to you, when you develop the project. When the project is used as a third-party library, the consumer's own `bsconfig.json` `package-specs` overrides the configuration here, logically.

## suffix

Either `".js"`, `".mjs"`, `".cjs"` or `".bs.js"`. Currently prefer `bs.js` for now.

### Design Decisions

Generating JS files with the `.bs.js` suffix means that, on the JS side, you can do `const myReScriptFile = require('./theFile.bs')`. The benefits:

- It's immediately clear that we're dealing with a generated JS file here.
- It avoids clashes with a potential `theFile.js` file in the same folder.
- It avoids the need of using a build system loader for ReScript files. This + in-source build means integrating a ReScript project into your pure JS codebase **basically doesn't touch anything in your build pipeline at all**.
- [genType](/docs/manual/latest/gentype-introduction) requires `bs.js` for compiled JS artifacts. If you are using `genType`, you need to use `bs.js` for now.

## warnings

Selectively turn on/off certain warnings and/or turn them into hard errors. Example:

```json
{
  "warnings": {
    "number": "-44-102",
    "error": "+5"
  }
}
```

Turn off warning `44` and `102` (polymorphic comparison). Turn warning `5` (partial application whose result has function type and is ignored) into a hard error.

The warning numbers are shown in the build output when they're triggered. See [Warning Numbers](./warning-numbers) for the complete list.

## bsc-flags

Extra flags to pass to the compiler. For advanced usages.

## Environment Variables

We heavily disrecommend the usage of environment variables, but for certain cases, they're justified.

### Error Output Coloring: `NINJA_ANSI_FORCED`

This is mostly for other programmatic usage of `rescript` where outputting colors is not desired.

When `NINJA_ANSI_FORCED` is set to `1`: `rescript` produces color.
When `NINJA_ANSI_FORCED` is set to `0`: `rescript` doesn't produce color.
When `NINJA_ANSI_FORCED` is not set: `rescript` might or might not produce color, depending on a smart detection of where it's outputted.

> Note that the underlying compiler will always be passed `-color always`. See more details in [this issue](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/issues/2984#issuecomment-410669163).
