# Migrate from BuckleScript/Reason

ReScript is a rebranding and cleanup of BuckleScript (since `v8.2.0`) & Reason (`v3.6`) that enables us to ship a tighter compile-to-JS stack with more coherent documentation & tools. If you're an existing user of BuckleScript & Reason, here's the gist:

- ReScript is mostly just BuckleScript rebranded, with a new syntax that's like the Reason syntax, but catered more toward the JavaScript crowd.
- All your existing code will keep working even if you don't upgrade.

## Upgrade Your Codebase

There are lots of exciting improvements in the new syntax (features, speed, error messages, etc.). The upgrade is trivial, backward-compatible and can be done on a per-file basis:

```
npm install rescript@9

# Also works with .rei / .ml / .mli / etc
npx rescript convert src/MyFile.re
```

Enjoy the improved experience!

### Upgrade Individual Folders

This is useful for per-directory convertions:

```console
# *.rei, *.ml, *.mli,....
for f in your-folder/**/*.re; do; node_modules/.bin/rescript convert $f && rm $f; done;
```

### Upgrade an Entire Codebase

In case you are confident in converting your codebase in one step, use the following:

```
npx rescript convert -all
```


## Difference With Old Reason

- Complete removal of semicolon (you can still write them).
- No need for parentheses around `if`, `switch` and `try`.
- Type arguments: from `option(int)` to `option<int>`.
- Old interpolated string: from `{j|hello ${name}|j}` to `` j`hello ${name}` ``. Now with proper unicode support!
- New interpolated string: `` `hello world` ``. Also supports multiline and unicode. `"hello world"` string is now singleline.
- Polymorphic variants: from `` `red`` to `#red`.
- Arrays: from `[|1,2,3|]` to `[1,2,3]`. In JS, arrays are the right default.
- Lists: from `[1,2,3]` to `list[1,2,3]` (_8.1.1 update_: now it is `list{1, 2, 3}`). This ties with upcoming plans to access containers in a uniform way: `set[...]` and `map[...]`. Maybe temporary.
- Exception: from `try (compute()) { | Not_found => Js.log("oops")}` to `try compute() catch { | Not_found => Js.log("oops")}`.
- First class module: from `(module S: Student)` to `module(S: Student)`.
- No custom infix operator for now (including `mod`).
- Object access: from `settings##visible #= true` to `settings["visible"] = true`. Rejoice!
- Object: from `Js.t({"age": int})` to just `{"age": int}`. The `Js.t` part is now uneeded.
- Attribute: from `[@myAttribute "hello"]` to `@myAttribute("hello")`. From `[%re bla]` to `%re(bla)`.
- Removed dereference syntax `result^`. Just use `result.contents`.
- `fun` pattern matching syntax removed.
- Type declaration is non-recursive by default, consistent with let bindings. To have recursive types, use `type rec myList<'a> = Nil | Cons('a, myList<'a>)`.
- Use any words, including reserved keywords, as your identifier name: `let \"try" = true`.
