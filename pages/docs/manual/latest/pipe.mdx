# Pipe

ReScript provides a tiny but surprisingly useful operator `->`, called the "pipe", that allows you to "flip" your code inside-out. `a(b)` becomes `b->a`. It's a simple piece of syntax that doesn't have any runtime cost.

Why would you use it? Imagine you have the following:

```res
validateAge(getAge(parseData(person)))
```

This is slightly hard to read, since you need to read the code from the innermost part, to the outer parts. Use pipe to streamline it:

```res
person
  ->parseData
  ->getAge
  ->validateAge
```

Basically, `parseData(person)` is transformed into `person->parseData`, and `getAge(person->parseData)` is transformed into `person->parseData->getAge`, etc.

**This works when the function takes more than one argument too**.

```res
a(one, two, three)
```

is the same as

```res
one->a(two, three)
```

This also works with labeled arguments.

Pipes are used to emulate object-oriented programming, e.g. what's `myStudent.getName` in other languages like Java would be `myStudent->getName` in ReScript (aka `getName(myStudent)`). This allows us to have the readability of the good parts of OOP without its downside of dragging in a huge class system just to call a function on a piece of data.

## Tips & Tricks

Try not to abuse pipes; they're a means to an end. Newcomers sometimes shape a library's API to take advantage of the pipe. This is backward and immature.

Conventionally, we don't turn the innermost layer of function call into a pipe. So the above example would usually be written as:

```res
parseData(person)
  ->getAge
  ->validateAge
```

## JS Method Chaining

_This section requires understanding of [our binding API](bind-to-js-function.md#object-method)_.

JavaScript's APIs are often attached to objects, and often chainable, like so:

```js
const result = [1, 2, 3].map(a => a + 1).filter(a => a % 2 === 0);

asyncRequest()
  .setWaitDuration(4000)
  .send();
```

Assuming we don't need the chaining behavior above, we'd bind to each case this using `bs.send` from the previous section:

```res
@bs.send external map: (array<'a>, 'a => 'b) => array<'b> = "map"
@bs.send external filter: (array<'a>, 'a => bool) => array<'a> = "filter"

type request
external asyncRequest: unit => request = "asyncRequest"
@bs.send external setWaitDuration: (request, int) => request = "setWaitDuration"
@bs.send external send: request => unit = "send"
```

You'd use them like this:

```res
let result = filter(map([1, 2, 3], a => a + 1), a => a mod 2 == 0)

send(setWaitDuration(asyncRequest(), 4000))
```

This looks much worse than the JS counterpart! Clean it up visually with pipe:

```res
let result = [1, 2, 3]
  ->map(a => a + 1)
  ->filter(a => a mod 2 === 0)

asyncRequest()->setWaitDuration(4000)->send
```

## Pipe Into Variants

You can pipe into a variant's constructor as if it was a function:

```res
let result = name->preprocess->Some
```

We turn this into:

```res
let result = Some(preprocess(name))
```

**Note** that using a variant constructor as a function wouldn't work anywhere else beside here.

## Pipe Placeholders

A placeholder is written as an underscore and it tells ReScript that you want to fill in an argument of a function later. These two have equivalent meaning:

```res
let addTo7 = (x) => add3(3, x, 4)
let addTo7 = add3(3, _, 4)
```

Sometimes you don't want to pipe the value you have into the first position. In these cases you can mark a placeholder value to show which argument you would like to pipe into.

Let's say you have a function `namePerson`, which takes a `person` then a `name` argument. If you are transforming a person then pipe will work as-is:

```res
makePerson(~age=47, ())
  ->namePerson("Jane")
```

If you have a name that you want to apply to a person object, you can use a placeholder:

```res
getName(input)
  ->namePerson(personDetails, _)
```

This allows you to pipe into any positional argument. It also works for named arguments:

```res
getName(input)
  ->namePerson(~person=personDetails, ~name=_)
```

## Triangle Pipe (Deprecated)

You might see usages of another pipe, `|>`, in some codebases. These are deprecated.

Unlike `->` pipe, the `|>` pipe puts the subject as the last (not first) argument of the function. `a |> f(b)` turns into `f(a, b)`.
