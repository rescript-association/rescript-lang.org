# Pinned Dependencies

**Since 8.4**

Usually we'd recommend to use ReScript in a single-codebase style by using one `bsconfig.json` file for your whole codebase.

There are scenarios where you still want to connect and build multiple independent ReScript packages for one main project though (`npm` workspaces-like "monorepos"). This is where `pinned-dependencies` come into play.

## Package Types

Before we go into detail, let's first explain all the different package types recognized by the build system:

- Toplevel (this is usually the final app you are building, which has dependencies to other packages)
- Pinned dependencies (these are your local packages that should always rebuild when you build your toplevel, those should be listed in `bs-dependencies` and `pinned-dependencies`)
- Normal dependencies (these are packages that are consumed from npm and listed via `bs-dependencies`)

Whenever a package is being built (`rescript build`), the build system will build the toplevel package with its pinned-dependencies. So any changes made in a pinned dependency will automatically be reflected in the final app.

## Build System Package Rules

The build system respects the following rules for each package type:

**Toplevel**
- Warnings reported
- Warn-error respected
- Builds dev dependencies
- Builds pinned dependencies
- Runs custom rules
- Package-specs like ES6/CommonJS overrides all its dependencies

**Pinned dependencies**
- Warnings reported
- Warn-error respected
- Ignores pinned dependencies
- Builds dev dependencies
- Runs custom rules

**Normal dependencies**
- Warnings, warn-error ignored
- Ignores dev directories
- Ignores pinned dependencies
- Ignores custom generator rules

So with that knowledge in mind, let's dive into some more concrete examples to see our pinned dependencies in action.

## Examples

### Yarn workspaces

Let's assume we have a codebase like this:

```
myproject/
  app/
   - src/App.res
   - bsconfig.json
  common/
   - src/Header.res
   - bsconfig.json
  myplugin/
   - src/MyPlugin.res
   - bsconfig.json
  package.json
```

Our `package.json` file within our codebase root would look like this:

```json
{
  "name": "myproject",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": {
    "packages": [
      "app",
      "common",
      "myplugin"
    ]
  }
}
```


Our `app` folder would be our toplevel package, consuming our `common` and `myplugin` packages as `pinned-dependencies`. The configuration for `app/bsconfig.json` looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "sources": {
    "dir" : "src",
    "subdirs" : true
  },
  /* ... */
  "bs-dependencies": [
    "common",
    "myplugin"
  ],
  "pinned-dependencies": ["common", "myplugin"],
  /* ... */
}
```

Now, whenever we are running `rescript build` within our `app` package, the compiler would always rebuild any changes within its pinned dependencies as well.

**Important:** ReScript will not rebuild any `pinned-dependencies` in watch mode! This is due to the complexity of file watching, so you'd need to set up your own file-watcher process that runs `rescript build` on specific file changes.
