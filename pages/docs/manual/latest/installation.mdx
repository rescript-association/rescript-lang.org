# Installation

Prerequisite: NPM, which comes with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) also works.

To install ReScript globally:

```sh
npm install -g bs-platform
```

## New Project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-project-template
cd rescript-project-template
npm install
npm run build
node src/Demo.bs.js
```

That compiles your ReScript into JavaScript, then uses NodeJS to run said JavaScript. **We recommend you use our unique workflow of keeping a tab open for the generated `.bs.js` file**, so that you can learn how ReScript transforms into JavaScript. Not many languages output clean JavaScript code you can inspect and learn from!

During development, instead of running `npm run build` each time to compile, use `npm run start` to start a watcher that recompiles automatically after file changes.

## Integrate Into Existing JS Project

If you already have a JavaScript project into which you'd like to add ReScript:

- Install ReScript locally as a [devDependency](https://docs.npmjs.com/specifying-dependencies-and-devdependencies-in-a-package-json-file):
  ```sh
  npm install --save-dev bs-platform
  ```
- Create a ReScript build configuration at the root:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "your-project-name",
    "sources": [
      {
        "dir": "src", // update this to wherever you're putting ReScript files
        "subdirs": true
      }
    ],
    "package-specs": [
      {
        "module": "es6",
        "in-source": true
      }
    ],
    "suffix": ".bs.js",
    "bs-dependencies": []
  }
  ```
  See [Build Configuration](build-configuration) for more details on `bsconfig.json`.
- Add convenience `npm` scripts to `package.json`:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "re:build": "bsb -make-world -clean-world",
    "re:start": "bsb -make-world -clean-world -w"
  }
  ```

Since ReScript compiles to clean readable JS files, the rest of your existing toolchain (e.g. Babel and Webpack) should just work!

### Integrate with a ReactJS Project

To start a [rescript-react](/docs/react/latest/introduction) app, or to integrate ReScript into an existing ReactJS app, follow the instructions [here](/docs/react/latest/installation).
