# Primitive Types

ReScript comes with the familiar primitive types like `string`, `int`, `float`, etc.

<!-- TODO: doc unit -->

## String

ReScript `string`s are delimited using **double** quotes (single quotes are reserved for the character type below).

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
let greeting = "Hello world!"
let multilineGreeting = "Hello
 world!"
```
```js
var greeting = "Hello world!";
var multilineGreeting = "Hello\n world!";
```

</CodeTab>

To concatenate strings, use `++`:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
let greetings = "Hello " ++ "world!"
```
```js
var greetings = "Hello world!";
```

</CodeTab>

### String Interpolation

There's a special syntax for string that allows

- multiline string just like before
- no special character escaping
- Interpolation
- Proper unicode handling

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
let name = "Joe"

let greeting = `Hello
World
👋
${name}
`
```
```js
var name = "Joe";

var greeting = "Hello\nWorld\n👋\n" + name + "\n";
```

</CodeTab>

This is just like JavaScript's backtick string interpolation, except without needing to escape special characters.

### Unsafe String Interpolation (Deprecated)

> ReScript v10.1.4 deprecated unsafe string interpolation and will be removed in v11.

For interpolation, you'll have to convert the binding (`name` in the example) into a string if it isn't one. If you want the interpolation to implicitly convert a binding into a string, prepend a `j`:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
let age = 10
let message = j`Today I am $age years old.`
```
```js
var message = "Today I am " + 10 + " years old.";
```

</CodeTab>

### Usage

See the familiar `Js.String` API in the [API docs](api/js/string). Since a ReScript string maps to a JavaScript string, you can mix & match the string operations in both standard libraries.

### Tips & Tricks

**You have a good type system now!** In an untyped language, you'd often overload the meaning of string by using it as:

- a unique id: `var BLUE_COLOR = "blue"`
- an identifier into a data structure: `var BLUE = "blue" var RED = "red" var colors = [BLUE, RED]`
- the name of an object field: `person["age"] = 24`
- an enum: `if (audio.canPlayType() === 'probably') {...}` [(ಠ_ಠ)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/canPlayType#Return_value)
- other crazy patterns you'll soon find horrible, after getting used to ReScript's alternatives.

The more you overload the poor string type, the less the type system (or a teammate) can help you! ReScript provides concise, fast and maintainable types & data structures alternatives to the use-cases above (e.g. variants, in a later section).

## Char

ReScript has a type for a string with a single letter:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
let firstLetterOfAlphabet = 'a'
```
```js
var firstLetterOfAlphabet = /* "a" */97;
```

</CodeTab>

**Note**: Char doesn't support Unicode or UTF-8 and is therefore not recommended.

To convert a String to a Char, use `String.get("a", 0)`. To convert a Char to a String, use `String.make(1, 'a')`.

## Regular Expression

ReScript regular expressions compile cleanly to their JavaScript counterpart:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
let r = %re("/b/g")
```
```js
var r = /b/g;
```

</CodeTab>

A regular expression like the above has the type `Js.Re.t`. The [Js.Re](api/js/re) module contains the regular expression helpers you have seen in JS.

## Boolean

A ReScript boolean has the type `bool` and can be either `true` or `false`. Common operations:

- `&&`: logical and.
- `||`: logical or.
- `!`: logical not.
- `<=`, `>=`, `<`, `>`
- `==`: structural equal, compares data structures deeply. `(1, 2) == (1, 2)` is `true`. Convenient, but use with caution.
- `===`: referential equal, compares shallowly. `(1, 2) === (1, 2)` is `false`. `let myTuple = (1, 2); myTuple === myTuple` is `true`.
- `!=`: structural unequal.
- `!==`: referential unequal.

ReScript's `true/false` compiles into a JavaScript `true/false`.

## Integers

32-bits, truncated when necessary. We provide the usual operations on them: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc. See [Js.Int](api/js/int) for helper functions.

**Be careful when you bind to JavaScript numbers!** Since ReScript integers have a much smaller range than JavaScript numbers, data might get lost when dealing with large numbers. In those cases, it’s much safer to bind the numbers as **floats**. Be extra mindful of this when binding to JavaScript Dates and their epoch time.

To improve readability, you may place underscores in the middle of numeric literals such as `1_000_000`. Note that underscores can be placed anywhere within a number, not just every three digits.

## Floats

Float requires other operators: `+.`, `-.`, `*.`, `/.`, etc. Like `0.5 +. 0.6`. See [Js.Float](api/js/float) for helper functions.

As with integers, you may use underscores within literals to improve readability.

## Unit

The `unit` type indicates the absence of a specific value. It has only a single value, `()`, which acts as a placeholder when no other value exists or is needed. It compiles to JavaScript's `undefined` and resembles the `void` type in languages such as C++. What's the point of such a type?

Consider the `Math.random` function. Its type signature is `unit => float`, which means it receives a `unit` as input and calculates a random `float` as output. You use the function like this - `let x = Math.random()`. Notice `()` as the first and only function argument.

Imagine a simplified `Console.log` function that prints a message. Its type signature is `string => unit` and you'd use it like this `Console.log("Hello!")`. It takes a string as input, prints it, and then returns nothing useful. When `unit` is the output of a function it means the function performs some kind of side-effect. 

## Unknown

The `unknown` type represents values with contents that are a mystery or are not 100% guaranteed to be what you think they are. It provides type-safety when interacting with data received from an untrusted source. For example, suppose an external function is supposed to return a `string`. It might. But if the documentation is not accurate or the code has bugs, the function could return `null`, an `array`, or something else you weren't expecting.

The ReScript type system helps you avoid run-time crashes and unpredicatable behavior by preventing you from using `unknown` in places that expect a `string` or `int` or some other type. The ReScript core libraries also provide utility functions to help you inspect `unknown` values and access their contents. In some cases you may need a JSON parsing library to convert `unknown` values to types you can safely use.   

Consider using `unknown` when receiving data from [external JavaScript functions](/docs/manual/latest/bind-to-js-function)
