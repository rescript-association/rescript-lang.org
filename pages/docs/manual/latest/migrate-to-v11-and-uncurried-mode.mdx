# Migrate to ReScript 11

## Minimal Migration

This guide describes the things to do at least to migrate to ReScript 11.

### Disable uncurried mode

If you use currying extensively and don't want to bother with adapting your code (or have dependencies )

```json
{
  "uncurried": false
}
```

## Recommended Migration

### Uncurried Mode

For uncurried mode to take effect in ReScript 11 there is nothing to configure, it is activated by default.

### Adapt suffix

ReScript 11 now allows having arbitrary suffixes in the generated JavaScript files. However it is still recommended to stick to using `.res.js`, `.res.mjs` or `.res.cjs`. For more information, read the Build System Configuration about [suffixes](/docs/manual/latest/build-configuration#suffix).

### rescript.json

The old configuration filename `bsconfig.json` is finally deprecated. Rename it to `rescript.json`.

### ReScript-Core standard library

There is a new standard library in development that can already be installed called ReScript-Core. It replaces the complete `Js` module as well as some of the more frequently used modules from `Belt` and is the recommended standard library to use with uncurried mode. At a later stage it will be integrated into the compiler while `Belt` will be maintaned as a separate npm package.

Until it's integrated in the compiler, it needs to be installed manually:

```console
$ npm install @rescript/core
```

Then add `@rescript/core` to your `rescript.json`'s dependencies:

```diff
 {
   "bs-dependencies": [
+    "@rescript/core"
   ]
 }
```

Open it so it's available in the global scope.

```diff
 {
   "bsc-flags": [
+    "-open RescriptCore",
   ]
 }
```

For a detailed explanation on migration to ReScript-Core, please refer to its [migration guide](https://github.com/rescript-association/rescript-core#migration). A semi-automated script is available as well.

**Note**: ReScript-Core API docs will be added to this documentation platform at a later stage. For now check out the `.resi` files in the repository or, more conveniently, read the docs for a certain module or function directly in the editor tooling.

### Removed bindings

Many Node bindings have been removed from the compiler. Please use [rescript-nodejs](https://github.com/TheSpyder/rescript-nodejs) instead or write your own local bindings.
