# Let Binding

A "let binding", in other languages, might be called a "variable declaration". `let` _binds_ values to names. They can be seen and referenced by code that comes _after_ them.

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
let greeting = "hello!"
let score = 10
let newScore = 10 + score
```
```js
var greeting = "hello!";
var score = 10;
var newScore = 20;
```

</CodeTab>

## Block Scope

Bindings can be scoped through `{}`.

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
let message = {
  let part1 = "hello"
  let part2 = "world"
  part1 ++ " " ++ part2
}
// `part1` and `part2` not accessible here!
```
```js
var message = "hello world";
```

</CodeTab>

The value of the last line of a scope is implicitly returned.

### Design Decisions

ReScript's `if`, `while` and functions all use the same block scoping mechanism. The code below works **not** because of some special "if scope"; but simply because it's the same scope syntax and feature you just saw:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
if displayGreeting {
  let message = "Enjoying the docs so far?"
  Js.log(message)
}
// `message` not accessible here!
```
```js
if (displayGreeting) {
  console.log("Enjoying the docs so far?");
}
```

</CodeTab>

## Bindings Are Immutable

Let bindings are "immutable", aka "cannot change". This helps our type system deduce and optimize much more than other languages (and in turn, help you more).

## Binding Shadowing

The above restriction might sound unpractical at first. How would you change a value then? Usually, 2 ways:

The first is to realize that many times, what you want isn't to mutate a variable's value. For example, this JavaScript pattern:

```js
var result = 0;
result = calculate(result);
result = calculateSomeMore(result);
```

...is really just to comment on intermediate steps. You didn't need to mutate `result` at all! You could have just written this JS:

```js
var result1 = 0;
var result2 = calculate(result1);
var result3 = calculateSomeMore(result2);
```

In ReScript, this obviously works too:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
let result1 = 0
let result2 = calculate(result1)
let result3 = calculateSomeMore(result2)
```
```js
var result1 = 0;
var result2 = calculate(0);
var result3 = calculateSomeMore(result2);
```

</CodeTab>

Additionally, reusing the same let binding name overshadows the previous bindings with the same name. So you can write this too:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
let result = 0
let result = calculate(result)
let result = calculateSomeMore(result)
```
```js
var result = calculate(0);
var result$1 = calculateSomeMore(result);
```

</CodeTab>

(Though for the sake of clarity, we don't recommend this).

As a matter of fact, even this is valid code:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
let result = "hello"
Console.log(result) // prints "hello"
let result = 1
Console.log(result) // prints 1
```
```js
var result = 1;
console.log("hello");
console.log(1);
```

</CodeTab>

The binding you refer to is whatever's the closest upward. No mutation here!
If you need _real_ mutation, e.g. passing a value around, have it modified by many pieces of code, we provide a slightly heavier [mutation feature](mutation.md).

## Private let bindings

Private let bindings are introduced in the release [7.2](https://rescript-lang.org/blog/bucklescript-release-7-2).

In the module system, everything is public by default,
the only way to hide some values is by providing a separate signature to
list public fields and their types:

```res
module A: {
  let b: int
} = {
  let a = 3
  let b = 4
}
```
`%%private` gives you an option to mark private fields directly

```res
module A = {
  %%private(let a = 3)
  let b = 4
}
```

`%%private` also applies to file level modules, so in some cases,
users do not need to provide a separate interface file just to hide some particular values.

Note interface files are still recommended as a general best practice since they give you better
separate compilation units and also they're better for documentation.

Still, `%%private` is useful in the following scenarios:

- **Code generators.** Some code generators want to hide some values but it is sometimes very hard or time consuming for code generators to synthesize the types for public fields.

- **Quick prototyping.** During prototyping, we still want to hide some values, but the interface file is not stable yet, `%%private` provide you such convenience.
