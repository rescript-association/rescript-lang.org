# Array and List

## Array

Arrays are our primary ordered data structure. They work the same way as JavaScript arrays.

```res
let myArray = ["hello", "world", "how are you"]
```

### Usage

See the [Js.Array](/apis/javascript/latest/js/array) API.

Access & update an array item like so:

```res
let myArray = ["hello", "world", "how are you"]

let firstItem = myArray[0] // "hello"

myArray[0] = "hey"

// now ["hey", "world", "how are you"]
```

## List

We provide a singly linked lists. Lists are:

- homogeneous
- immutable
- fast at prepending items
- fast at getting the tail
- slow at everything else

```res
let myList = list{1, 2, 3}
```

### Usage

You'd use list for its resizability, its fast prepend (adding at the head), and its fast split, all of which are immutable and relatively efficient.

Do **not** use list if you need to randomly access an item or insert at non-head position. Your code would end up obtuse and/or slow.

The standard lib provides a [List module](https://reasonml.github.io/api/List.html).

#### Immutable Prepend

Use the spread syntax:

```res
let myList = list{1, 2, 3}
let anotherList = list{0, ...myList}
```

`myList` didn't mutate. `anotherList` is now `list{0, 1, 2, 3}`. This is efficient (constant time, not linear). `anotherList`'s last 3 elements are shared with `myList`!

**Note that `list{a, ...b, ...c}` is a syntax error**. We don't support multiple spread for a list. That'd be an accidental linear operation (`O(b)`), since each item of b would be one-by-one added to the head of `c`. You can use `List.concat` for this, but we highly discourage it.

Updating an arbitrary item in the middle of a list is also discouraged, since its performance and allocation overhead would be linear (`O(n)`).

#### Access

`switch` (described in the [pattern matching section](pattern-matching.md)) is usually used to access list items:

```res
let message =
  switch myList {
  | list{} => "This list is empty"
  | list{a, ...rest} => "The head of the list is the string " ++ Js.Int.toString(a)
  }
```
