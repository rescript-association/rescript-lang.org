# Lazy Value

If you have some expensive computations you'd like to **defer and cache** subsequently, you can wrap it with `lazy`:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res prelude
// Read the directory, only once
let expensiveFilesRead = lazy({
  Js.log("Reading dir")
  Node.Fs.readdirSync("./pages")
})
```
```js
var Fs = require("fs");

var expensiveFilesRead = {
  LAZY_DONE: false,
  VAL: (function () {
    console.log("Reading dir");
    return Fs.readdirSync("./pages");
  })
};
```

</CodeTab>

Check the JS Output tab: that `expensiveFilesRead`'s code isn't executed yet, even though you declared it! You can carry it around without fearing that it'll run the directory read.

**Note**: a lazy value is **not** a [shared data type](shared-data-types.md). Don't rely on its runtime representation in your JavaScript code.

## Execute The Lazy Computation

To actually run the lazy value's computation, use `Lazy.force` from the globally available `Lazy` module:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
// First call. The computation happens
Js.log(Lazy.force(expensiveFilesRead)) // logs "Reading dir" and the directory content

// Second call. Will just return the already calculated result
Js.log(Lazy.force(expensiveFilesRead)) // logs the directory content
```
```js
console.log(CamlinternalLazy.force(expensiveFilesRead));

console.log(CamlinternalLazy.force(expensiveFilesRead));
```

</CodeTab>

The first time `Lazy.force` is called, the expensive computation happens and the result is **cached**. The second time, the cached value is directly used.

**You can't re-trigger the computation after the first `force` call**. Make sure you only use a lazy value with computations whose results don't change (e.g. an expensive server request whose response is always the same).

Instead of using `Lazy.force`, you can also use [pattern matching](pattern-matching-destructuring.md) to trigger the computation:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
switch expensiveFilesRead {
| lazy(result) => Js.log(result)
}
```
```js
var result = CamlinternalLazy.force(expensiveFilesRead);
```

</CodeTab>

Since pattern matching also works on a `let` binding, you can also do:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
let lazy(result) = expensiveFilesRead
Js.log(result)
```
```js
var result = CamlinternalLazy.force(expensiveFilesRead);
console.log(result);
```

</CodeTab>

## Exception Handling

For completeness' sake, our files read example might raise an exception because of `readdirSync`. Here's how you'd handle it:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
let result = try {
  Lazy.force(expensiveFilesRead)
} catch {
| Not_found => [] // empty array of files
}
```
```js
var result;

try {
  result = CamlinternalLazy.force(expensiveFilesRead);
} catch (raw_exn) {
  var exn = Caml_js_exceptions.internalToOCamlException(raw_exn);
  if (exn.RE_EXN_ID === "Not_found") {
    result = [];
  } else {
    throw exn;
  }
}
```

</CodeTab>

Though you should probably handle the exception inside the lazy computation itself.
