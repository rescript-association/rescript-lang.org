# Libraries

ReScript libraries are just like JavaScript libraries: hosted on [NPM](http://npmjs.com).

If you can't find what you're looking for: sometimes **you don't need a wrapper** to use a JS library. Most JS data types, such as array and objects, [map over cleanly to ReScript and vice-versa](shared-data-types.md). You also have access to the familiar [JS API](/apis/latest/js). Be sure to also check the "Interop" and "Converting from JS" sections here!
