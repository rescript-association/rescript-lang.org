# External Stdlib

**Since 9.0**

Your ReScript project depends on the `rescript` package as a [`devDependency`](https://docs.npmjs.com/specifying-dependencies-and-devdependencies-in-a-package-json-file), which includes our compiler, build system and runtime like `Belt`. However, you had to move it to `dependency` in `package.json` if you publish your code:
- To Docker or other low-storage deployment devices.
- For pure JS/TS consumers who probably won't install `rescript` in their own project.

In these cases, the size or mere presence of `rescript` can be troublesome, since it includes not just our necessary runtime like `Belt`, but also our compiler and build system.

To solve that, we now publish our runtime as a standalone package at [`@rescript/std`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rescript/std), whose versions mirror `rescript`'s. Now you can keep `rescript` as a `devDependency` and have only `@rescript/std` as your runtime `dependency`.

**This is an advanced feature**. Please only use it in the aforementioned scenarios. If you already use a JS bundler with dead code elimination, you might not need this feature.

## Configuration

Say you want to publish a JS-only ReScript 9.0 library. Install the packages like this:

```sh
npm install rescript@11.0.1 --save-dev
npm install @rescript/std@11.0.1
```

Then add this to `rescript.json`:

```json
{
  // ...
  "external-stdlib" : "@rescript/std"
}
```

Now the compiled JS code will import using the path defined by `external-stdlib`. Check the JS output tab:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS output"]}>

```res
Array.forEach([1, 2, 3], num => Console.log(num))
```

```js
// Note the require path starting with "@rescript/std".
var Belt_Array = require("@rescript/std/lib/js/belt_Array.js");

Belt_Array.forEach([1, 2, 3], function (num) {
  console.log(num);
});
```

</CodeTab>

**Make sure the version number of `rescript` and `@rescript/std` match in your `package.json`** to avoid running into runtime issues due to mismatching stdlib assumptions.
