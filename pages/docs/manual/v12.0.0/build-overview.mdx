# Build System Overview

ReScript comes with a build system, [`rescript`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rescript), that's fast, lean and used as the authoritative build system of the community.

Every ReScript project needs a build description file, `rescript.json`.

## Options

See `rescript help`:

```
❯ rescript help
Usage: rescript <options> <subcommand>

`rescript` is equivalent to `rescript build`

Options:
  -v, -version  display version number
  -h, -help     display help

Subcommands:
  build
  clean
  format
  convert
  dump
  help

Run `rescript <subcommand> -h` for subcommand help. Examples:
  rescript build -h
  rescript format -h
```

## Build Project

Each build will create build artifacts from your project's source files.

**To build a project (including its dependencies / pinned-dependencies)**, run:

```sh
rescript
```

Which is an alias for `rescript build`.

To keep a build watcher, run:

```sh
rescript -w
```

Any new file change will be picked up and the build will re-run.

**Note**: third-party libraries (in `node_modules`, or via `pinned-dependencies`) aren't watched, as doing so may exceed the node.js watcher count limit.

**Note 2**: In case you want to set up a project in a JS-monorepo-esque approach (`npm` and `yarn` workspaces) where changes in your sub packages should be noticed by the build, you will need to define pinned dependencies in your main project's `rescript.json`. More details [here](./build-pinned-dependencies).

## Clean Project

If you ever get into a stale build for edge-case reasons, use:

```sh
rescript clean
```

## Compile with stricter errors in CI

**Since 11.1**

You may want to compile your project with stricter rules for production, than when developing. With the `-warn-error` build flag, this can easily be done, for instance in a continuous integration script. E.g.:

```sh
rescript -warn-error +110
```

Here, warning number 110, which is triggered when a [`%todo`](/syntax-lookup#todo) has been found, gets promoted to an error. The full list of warning numbers can be found [here](/docs/manual/next/warning-numbers).
