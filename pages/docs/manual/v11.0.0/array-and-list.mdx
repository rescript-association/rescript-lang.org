# Array and List

## Array

Arrays are our main ordered data structure. They work the same way as JavaScript arrays: they can be randomly accessed, dynamically resized, updated, etc.

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
let myArray = ["hello", "world", "how are you"]
```
```js
var myArray = ["hello", "world", "how are you"];
```

</CodeTab>

ReScript arrays' items must have the same type, i.e. homogeneous.

### Usage
#### Access
Accessing items in an array will return an `option` and can be done like so:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
let myArray = ["hello", "world", "how are you"]

let firstItem = myArray[0] // Some("hello")

let tenthItem = myArray->Array.get(10) // None
```
```js
var myArray = ["hello", "world", "how are you"];

var firstItem = myArray[0];

var tenthItem = myArray[10];
```

</CodeTab>

The behavior of returning an `option` is new to V11 when you have [Core](api/core) open. 
It provides a safer way to access array items, which is especially useful when you're not sure if the index is out of bounds.
If you would like to not use an `option`, you can use [`Array.getUnsafe`](api/core/array#value-getUnsafe).

#### Update
Items in an array can be updated by assigning a value to an index or using a function:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
let myArray = ["hello", "world", "how are you"]

myArray[0] = "hey" // now ["hey", "world", "how are you"]

myArray->Array.push("?") //  ["hey", "world", "how are you", "?"]

myArray->Array.set(0, "bye") //  ["bye", "world", "how are you", "?"]
```
```js
var myArray = ["hello", "world", "how are you"];

myArray[0] = "hey";

myArray.push("?");

myArray[0] = "bye";
```

</CodeTab>

### Array spreads

**Since 11.1**


You can spread arrays of the the same type into new arrays, just like in JavaScript:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
let y = [1, 2]
let x = [4, 5, ...y]
let x2 = [4, 5, ...y, 7, ...y]
let x3 = [...y]
```

```javascript
var Belt_Array = require("rescript/lib/js/belt_Array.js");

var y = [
  1,
  2
];

var x = Belt_Array.concatMany([
      [
        4,
        5
      ],
      y
    ]);

var x2 = Belt_Array.concatMany([
      [
        4,
        5
      ],
      y,
      [7],
      y
    ]);

var x3 = Belt_Array.concatMany([y]);
```
</CodeTab>

> Note that array spreads compiles to `Belt.Array.concatMany` right now. This is likely to change to native array spreads in the future.

## List

ReScript provides a singly linked list too. Lists are:

- immutable
- fast at prepending items
- fast at getting the head
- slow at everything else

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
let myList = list{1, 2, 3}
```
```js
var myList = {
  hd: 1,
  tl: {
    hd: 2,
    tl: {
      hd: 3,
      tl: 0
    }
  }
};
```

</CodeTab>

Like arrays, lists' items need to be of the same type.

### Usage

You'd use list for its resizability, its fast prepend (adding at the head), and its fast split, all of which are immutable and relatively efficient.

Do **not** use list if you need to randomly access an item or insert at non-head position. Your code would end up obtuse and/or slow.

The standard lib provides a [List module](api/core/list).

#### Immutable Prepend

Use the spread syntax:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res prelude
let myList = list{1, 2, 3}
let anotherList = list{0, ...myList}
```
```js
var myList = {
  hd: 1,
  tl: {
    hd: 2,
    tl: {
      hd: 3,
      tl: 0
    }
  }
};

var anotherList = {
  hd: 0,
  tl: myList
};
```

</CodeTab>

`myList` didn't mutate. `anotherList` is now `list{0, 1, 2, 3}`. This is efficient (constant time, not linear). `anotherList`'s last 3 elements are shared with `myList`!

**Note that `list{a, ...b, ...c}` was a syntax error** before compiler v10.1. In general, the pattern should be used with care as its performance and allocation overhead are linear (`O(n)`).

#### Access

`switch` (described in the [pattern matching section](pattern-matching-destructuring.md)) is usually used to access list items:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
let message =
  switch myList {
  | list{} => "This list is empty"
  | list{a, ...rest} => "The head of the list is the string " ++ Int.toString(a)
  }
```
```js
var message = myList
  ? "The head of the list is the string " + (1).toString()
  : "This list is empty";
```

</CodeTab>
