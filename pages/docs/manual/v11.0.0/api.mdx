# Overview

## ReScript Core

[Core](api/core) is ReScript's new standard library. It replaces the complete `Js` module as well as some of the more frequently used modules from `Belt` and is recommended to use with uncurried mode.

In ReScript 11, it is shipped as a separate npm package `@rescript/core` that is added to your project as per the [installation instructions](/docs/manual/latest/installation). In future ReScript versions, it will be included with the `rescript` npm package itself.

## Additional Libraries

ReScript ships with these two additional modules in its standard library:

- [Belt](api/belt): immutable collections and extra helpers not available in JavaScript / [Core](api/core).
- [Dom](api/dom): Dom related types and modules. Contains our standardized types used by various userland DOM bindings.

## Legacy Modules

The [Js](api/js) module is superseded by [Core](api/core).
