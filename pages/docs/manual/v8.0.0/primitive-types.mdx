# Primitive Types

ReScript comes with the familiar primitive types like `string`, `int`, `float`, etc.

## String

ReScript `string`s are delimited using **double** quotes (single quotes are reserved for the character type below).

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```re
let greeting = "Hello world!";
let multilineGreeting = "Hello
 world!";
```
```ml
let greeting = "Hello world!"
let multilineGreeting = "Hello
 world!";
```
```js
var greeting = "Hello world!";
var multilineGreeting = "Hello\n world!";
```

</CodeTab>

To concatenate strings, use `++`:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```re
let greetings = "Hello " ++ "world!";
```
```ml
let greetings = "Hello " ^ "world!"
```
```js
var greetings = "Hello world!";
```

</CodeTab>

### String Interpolation

There's a special syntax for string that allows

- multiline string just like before
- Interpolation

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```re
let greeting = {j|Hello
World
$(name)
|j}
```
```ml
let greeting = {j|Hello
World
$(name)
|j}
```
```js
var greeting = "Hello\nWorld\n" + name + "\n";
```

</CodeTab>

This is just like JavaScript's backtick string interpolation.

### Usage

See the familiar `Js.String` API in the [API docs](api/js/string). Since a ReScript string maps to a JavaScript string, you can mix & match the string operations in both standard libraries.

### Tips & Tricks

**You have a good type system now**! In an untyped language, you'd often overload the meaning of string by using it as:

- a unique id: `var BLUE_COLOR = "blue"`
- an identifier into a data structure: `var BLUE = "blue" var RED = "red" var colors = [BLUE, RED]`
- the name of an object field: `person["age"] = 24`
- an enum: `if (audio.canPlayType() === 'probably') {...}` [(ಠ_ಠ)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/canPlayType#Return_value)
- other crazy patterns you'll soon find horrible, after getting used to ReScript's alternatives.

The more you overload the poor string type, the less the type system (or a teammate) can help you! ReScript provides concise, fast and maintainable types & data structures alternatives to the use-cases above (e.g. variants, in a later section).

## Char

ReScript has a type for a string with a single letter:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```re
let firstLetterOfAlphabet = 'a';
```
```ml
let firstLetterOfAlphabet = 'a'
```
```js
var firstLetterOfAlphabet = /* "a" */97;
```

</CodeTab>

**Note**: Char doesn't support Unicode or UTF-8 and is therefore not recommended.

To convert a String to a Char, use `"a".[0]`. To convert a Char to a String, use `String.make(1, 'a')`.

## Regular Expression

ReScript regular expressions compile cleanly to their JavaScript counterpart:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```re
let r = [%re "/b/g"];
```
```ml
let r = [%re "/b/g"]
```
```js
var r = /b/g;
```

</CodeTab>

A regular expression like the above has the type `Js.Re.t`. The [Js.Re](api/js/re) module contains the regular expression helpers you have seen in JS.

## Boolean

A ReScript boolean has the type `bool` and can be either `true` or `false`. Common operations:

- `&&`: logical and.
- `||`: logical or.
- `!`: logical not.
- `<=`, `>=`, `<`, `>`
- `==`: structural equal, compares data structures deeply: `(1, 2) == (1, 2)` is `true`. Convenient, but use with caution.
- `===`: referential equal, compares shallowly. `(1, 2) === (1, 2)` is `false`. `let myTuple = (1, 2); myTuple === myTuple` is `true`.
- `!=`: structural unequal.
- `!==`: referential unequal.

ReScript's `true/false` compiles into a JavaScript `true/false`.

## Integers

32-bits, truncated when necessary. We provide the usual operations on them: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc. See [Js.Int](api/js/int) for helper functions.

**Careful when you bind to JavaScript numbers**! Long ones might be truncated. Bind JS number (especially Dates) as **float** instead.

## Floats

Float requires other operators: `+.`, `-.`, `*.`, `/.`, etc. Like `0.5 +. 0.6`. See [Js.Float](api/js/float) for helper functions.

## Unit

The `unit` type has a single value, `()`. It compiles to JavaScrit's `undefined`. It's a dummy type used as a placeholder in various places. You won't need it until you see it.
