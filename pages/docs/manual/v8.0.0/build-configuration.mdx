# Configuration

`bsconfig.json` is the single, mandatory build meta file needed for bsb.

**The complete configuration schema is [here](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/docson/#build-schema.json)**. We'll _non-exhaustively_ highlight the important parts in prose here.

## name, namespace

`name` is the name of the library, used as its "namespace". You can activate namespacing through `"namespace": true` in your `bsconfig.json`. Namespacing is almost **mandatory**; we haven't turned it on by default yet to preserve backward-compatibility.

**Explanation**: by default, your files, once used as a third-party dependency, are available globally to the consumer. E.g. if you have an `Util.re` and the consumer also has a file of the same name, they will clash. Turning on `namespace` avoids this by wrapping all your own project's files into an extra module layer; instead of a global `Util` module, the consumer will see you as `MyProject.Util`. **The namespacing affects your consumers, not yourself**.

Aka, in Bsb, "namespace" is just a fancy term for an auto-generated module that wraps all your project's files (efficiently and correctly, of course!) for third-party consumption.

We don't do folder-level namespacing for your own project; all your own file names must be unique. This is a constraint that enables several features such as fast search and easier project reorganization.

**Note**: the `bsconfig.json` `name` should be the same as the `package.json` `name`, to avoid confusing corner-cases. However, this means that you can't use a camelCased names such as `MyProject`, since `package.json` and npm forbid you to do so (some file systems are case-insensitive). To have the namespace/module as `MyProject`, write `"name": "my-project"`. Bsb will turn that into the camelCased name correctly.

**Note on custom namespacing**: if for some reason, you need a namespace that is different from what your `name` will produce, you can directly send a string to the `namespace` option. For example, if your package is a binding named `bs-some-thing`, you can use `"namespace": "some-thing"` to get `SomeThing` namespace instead of `BsSomeThing`.

## sources

Your source files need to be specified explicitly (we don't want to accidentally drill down into some unrelated directories). Examples:

```json
{
  "sources": ["src", "examples"]
}
```

```json
{
  "sources": {
    "dir": "src",
    "subdirs": ["page"]
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "sources": [
    "examples",
    {
      "dir": "src",
      "subdirs": true // recursively builds every subdirectory
    }
  ]
}
```

You can mark your directories as dev-only (for e.g. tests). These won't be built and exposed to third-parties, or even to other "dev" directories in the same project:

```json
{
  "sources": {
    "dir": "test",
    "type": "dev"
  }
}
```

## bs-dependencies, bs-dev-dependencies

List of ReScript dependencies. Just like `package.json`'s dependencies, they'll be searched in `node_modules`.

Note that only sources marked with `"type":"dev"` will be able to resolve modules from `bs-dev-dependencies`.

## reason, refmt (old)

`reason` config is enabled by default. To turn on JSX for [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/en/), specify:

```json
{
  "reason": { "react-jsx": 3 },
  "refmt": 3
}
```

The `refmt` config **should be explicitly specified** as `3`.

## js-post-build

Hook that's invoked every time a file is recompiled. Good for JS build system interop, but please use it **sparingly**. Calling your custom command for every recompiled file slows down your build and worsens the building experience for even third-party users of your lib.

Example:

```json
{
  "js-post-build": {
    "cmd": "/path/to/node ../../postProcessTheFile.js"
  }
}
```

Note that the command's path resolution is done through the following:

- `/myCommand` is resolved into `/myCommand`
- `myCommand/` is resolved into `node_modules/myCommand`
- `./myCommand` is resolved into `myProjectRoot/myCommand`
- `myCommand` is just called as `myCommand`. But note that Bsb doesn't read into your environment, so if you put `node`, it won't find it unless you specify an absolute path. Alternatively, point to a script that has the header `#!/usr/local/bin/node`.

The command itself is called from inside `lib/bs`.

## package-specs

Output to either CommonJS (the default) or ES6 modules. Example:

```json
{
  "package-specs": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "in-source": true
  }
}
```

- `"module": "es6-global"` resolves `node_modules` using relative paths. Good for development-time usage of ES6 in conjunction with browsers like Safari and Firefox that support ES6 modules today. **No more dev-time bundling**!
- `"in-source": true` generates output alongside source files. If you omit it, it'll generate the artifacts into `lib/js`. The output directory is not configurable otherwise.

This configuration only applies to you, when you develop the project. When the project is used as a third-party library, the consumer's own `bsconfig.json` `package-specs` overrides the configuration here, logically.

## suffix

Either `".js"` or `".bs.js"`. Strongly prefer the latter.

### Design Decisions

Generating JS files with the `.bs.js` suffix means that, on the JS side, you can do `const myReScriptFile = require('./theFile.bs')`. The benefits:

- It's immediately clear that we're dealing with a generated JS file here.
- It avoids clashes with a potential `theFile.js` file in the same folder.
- It avoids the need of using a build system loader for ReScript files. This + in-source build means integrating a ReScript project into your pure JS codebase **basically doesn't touch anything in your build pipeline at all**.
- The `.bs.js` suffix [lets bsb track JS artifacts much better](build-overview.md#tips-tricks).

## warnings

Selectively turn on/off certain warnings and/or turn them into hard errors. Example:

```json
{
  "warnings": {
    "number": "-44-102",
    "error": "+5"
  }
}
```

Turn off warning `44` and `102` (polymorphic comparison). Turn warning `5` (partial application whose result has function type and is ignored) into a hard error.

The warning number are shown in the build output when they're triggered. The complete list is [here](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/comp.html#sec281), a little bit below. `100` and up are ReScript-specific.

## bsc-flags

Extra flags to pass to the underlying `bsc` call. Notably: `["-bs-super-errors"]` for turning on cleaner error output. No need to pass this flag for a new ReScript project; it's enabled by default.

## Environment Variables

We heavily disrecommend the usage of environment variables, but for certain cases, they're justified.

### Error Output Coloring: `NINJA_ANSI_FORCED`

This is mostly for other programmatic usage of `bsb` where outputting colors is not desired.

When `NINJA_ANSI_FORCED` is set to `1`: `bsb` produces color.
When `NINJA_ANSI_FORCED` is set to `0`: `bsb` doesn't produce color.
When `NINJA_ANSI_FORCED` is not set: `bsb` might or might not produce color, depending on a smart detection of where it's outputted.

> Note that bsc, the barebone compiler, will always be passed `-color always`. See more details in [this issue](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript/issues/2984#issuecomment-410669163).

### BS_VSCODE error output adapted for VSCODE

If you run bsb under VSCODE task runner like [this](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript/blob/master/jscomp/bsb/templates/basic-reason/.vscode/tasks.json#L6), it is recommended to have BS_VSCODE set
