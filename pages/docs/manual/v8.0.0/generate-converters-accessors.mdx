# Generate Converters & Helpers

<!-- TODO: genType -->

When using ReScript, you will sometimes come into situations where you want to

- Automatically generate functions that convert between ReScript's internal and JS runtime values (e.g. variants).
- Convert a record type into an abstract type with generated creation, accessor and method functions.
- Generate some other helper functions, such as functions from record attribute names.

You can use the `@bs.deriving` decorator to trigger code generation. All different options and configurations will be discussed on this page.

**Note:** Please be aware that extensive use of code generation might make it harder to understand your programs (since the code being generated is not visible in the source code, and you just need to know what kind of functions / values a decorator generates).

**Another Note:** Since `v8.3` you can drop the `bs.` prefix for all our decorators (e.g. `@bs.deriving` => `@deriving`).

## Generate Functions & Plain Values for Variants

Use `[@bs.deriving accessors]` on a variant type to create accessor functions for its constructors.

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```reason
[@bs.deriving accessors]
type action =
  | Click
  | Submit(string)
  | Cancel;
```

```ocaml
type action =
  | Click
  | Submit of string
  | Cancel
  [@@bs.deriving accessors]
```

```js
function submit(param_0) {
  return /* Submit */[param_0];
}

var click = /* Click */0;

var cancel = /* Cancel */1;

exports.click  = click;
exports.submit = submit;
exports.cancel = cancel;
```

</CodeTab>

Variants constructors with payloads generate functions, payload-less constructors generate plain integers (the internal representation of variants).

**Note**:
- The generated accessors are lower-cased.
- You can now use these helpers on the JavaScript side! But don't rely on their actual values please.

### Usage

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)"]}>

```reason
let s = submit("hello"); /* gives Submit("hello") */
```

```ocaml
let s = submit "hello" (* gives Submit("hello") *)
```

</CodeTab>

This is useful:

- When you're passing the accessor function as a higher-order function (which plain variant constructors aren't).
- When you'd like the JS side to use these values & functions opaquely and pass you back a variant constructor (since JS has no such thing).

Please note that in case you just want to _pipe a payload into a constructor_, you don't need to generate functions for that. Use the `->` syntax instead, e.g. `"test"->Submit`.

## Generate Field Accessors for Records

Use `[@bs.deriving accessors]` on a record type to create accessors for its record field names.


<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```reason
[@bs.deriving accessors]
type pet = {
  name: string,
};

let pets = [|{name: "bob"}, {name: "bob2"}|];

pets
  ->Belt.Array.map(name)
  ->Js.Array2.joinWith("&")
  ->Js.log;
```

```ocaml
type pet = {
  name: string;
}[@@bs.deriving accessors]

let pets = [|{ name = ("bob") }; { name = ("bob2") }|]

let _ =
  ((((pets |. Belt.Array.map) name) |. Js.Array2.joinWith)
     ("&"))
    |. Js.log
```

```js
function name(param) {
  return param.name;
}

var pets = [
  {
    name: "bob"
  },
  {
    name: "bob2"
  }
];

console.log(Belt_Array.map(pets, name).join("&"));
```

</CodeTab>

## Generate Converters for JS Object and Record

> **Note:** In ReScript >= v7 [records are already compiled to JS
> objects](bind-to-js-object#bind-to-record-like-js-objects). `[@bs.deriving jsConverter]` is therefore
> obsolete and will generate a no-op function for compatibility instead.

Use `[@bs.deriving jsConverter]` on a record type to create convertion functions between records / JS object runtime values.


<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)"]}>

```reason
[@bs.deriving jsConverter]
type coordinates = {
  x: int,
  y: int
};
```

```ocaml
type coordinates = {
  x: int;
  y: int;
}[@@bs.deriving jsConverter]
```

</CodeTab>

Generates 2 functions of the following types:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)"]}>

```reason
let coordinatesToJs: coordinates => {. "x": int, "y": int};

let coordinatesFromJs: {.. "x": int, "y": int} => coordinates;
```

```ocaml
val coordinatesToJs : coordinates -> < x: int; y: int>  Js.t

val coordinatesFromJs : < x: int; y: int ; .. >  Js.t -> coordinates
```

</CodeTab>

**Note**:

- `coordinatesFromJs` uses an open object type that accepts more fields, just to be more permissive.
- The converters are shallow. They don't recursively drill into the fields and convert them. This preserves the speed and simplicity of output while satisfying 80% of use-cases.

### Usage

This exports a `jsCoordinates` JS object (not a record!) for JS files to use:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)"]}>

```reason
let jsCoordinates = coordinatesToJs({x: 1, y: 2});
```

```ocaml
let jsCoordinates = coordinatesToJs { x = 1; y = 2 }
```

</CodeTab>

This binds to a `jsCoordinates` record (not a JS object!) that exists on the JS side, presumably created by JS calling the function `coordinatesFromJs`:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)"]}>

```reason
[@bs.module "myGame"] external jsCoordinates : coordinates = "jsCoordinates";
```

```ocaml
external jsCoordinates : coordinates = "jsCoordinates"[@@bs.module "myGame"]
```

</CodeTab>

### More Safety

The above generated functions use `Js.t` object types. You can also hide this implementation detail by making the object type **abstract** by using the `newType` option with `[@bs.deriving jsConverter]`:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)"]}>

```reason
[@bs.deriving {jsConverter: newType}]
type coordinates = {
  x: int,
  y: int
};
```

```ocaml
type coordinates = {
  x: int ;
  y: int
} [@@bs.deriving { jsConverter = newType }]
```

</CodeTab>

Generates 2 functions of the following types:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)"]}>

```reason
let coordinatesToJs: coordinates => abs_coordinates;

let coordinatesFromJs: abs_coordinates => coordinates;
```

```ocaml
val coordinatesToJs : coordinates -> abs_coordinates

val coordinatesFromJs : abs_coordinates -> coordinates
```

</CodeTab>

#### Usage

Using `newType`, you've now prevented consumers from inadvertently doing the following:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)"]}>

```reason
let myCoordinates = {
  x: 10,
  y: 20
};
let jsCoords = coordinatesToJs(myCoordinates);

let x = jsCoords##x; /* disallowed! Don't access the object's internal details */
```

```ocaml
let myCoordinates = {
  x = 10;
  y = 20
}

let jsCoords = coordinatesToJs myCoordinates

let x = jsCoords ## x (* disallowed! Don't access the object's internal details *)
```

</CodeTab>

Same generated output. Isn't it great that types prevent invalid accesses you'd otherwise have to encode at runtime?

## Generate Converters for JS Integer Enums and Variants

Use `[@bs.deriving jsConverter]` on a variant type to create converter functions that allow back and forth conversion between JS integer enum and ReScript variant values.

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)"]}>

```reason
[@bs.deriving jsConverter]
type fruit =
  | Apple
  | Orange
  | Kiwi
  | Watermelon;
```

```ocaml
type fruit =
  | Apple 
  | Orange 
  | Kiwi 
  | Watermelon [@@bs.deriving jsConverter]
```

</CodeTab>

This option causes `jsConverter` to, again, generate functions of the following types:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)"]}>

```reason
let fruitToJs: fruit => int;

let fruitFromJs: int => option(fruit);
```

```ocaml
val fruitToJs : fruit -> int

val fruitFromJs : int -> fruit option
```

</CodeTab>

For `fruitToJs`, each fruit variant constructor would map into an integer, starting at 0, in the order they're declared.

For `fruitFromJs`, the return value is an `option`, because not every int maps to a constructor.

You can also attach a `[@bs.as alternativeIntValue]` to each constructor to customize their output.

### Usage

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)"]}>

```reason
[@bs.deriving jsConverter]
type fruit =
  | Apple
  | [@bs.as 10] Orange
  | [@bs.as 100] Kiwi
  | Watermelon;

let zero = fruitToJs(Apple); /* 0 */

switch (fruitFromJs(100)) {
| Some(Kiwi) => Js.log("this is Kiwi")
| _ => Js.log("received something wrong from the JS side")
};
```

```ocaml
type fruit =
  | Apple 
  | Orange [@bs.as 10]
  | Kiwi [@bs.as 100]
  | Watermelon [@@bs.deriving jsConverter]

let zero = fruitToJs Apple;;

match fruitFromJs 100 with
  | ((Some (Kiwi))[@explicit_arity ]) -> Js.log "this is Kiwi"
  | _ -> Js.log "received something wrong from the JS side"
```

</CodeTab>

**Note**: by using `bs.as` here, all subsequent number encoding changes. `Apple` is still `0`, `Orange` is `10`, `Kiwi` is `100` and `Watermelon` is **`101`**!

### More Safety

Similar to the JS object <-> record deriving, you can hide the fact that the JS enum are ints by using the same `newType` option with `[@bs.deriving jsConverter]`:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)"]}>

```reason
[@bs.deriving {jsConverter: newType}]
type fruit =
  | Apple
  | [@bs.as 100] Kiwi
  | Watermelon;
```

```ocaml
type fruit =
  | Apple 
  | Kiwi [@bs.as 100]
  | Watermelon [@@bs.deriving { jsConverter = newType }]
```

</CodeTab>

This option causes `jsConverter` to generate functions of the following types:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)"]}>

```reason
let fruitToJs: fruit => abs_fruit;

let fruitFromJs: abs_fruit => fruit;
```

```ocaml
val fruitToJs : fruit -> abs_fruit

val fruitFromJs : abs_fruit -> fruit
```

</CodeTab>

For `fruitFromJs`, the return value, unlike the previous non-abstract type case, doesn't contain an `option`, because there's no way a bad value can be passed into it; the only creator of `abs_fruit` values is `fruitToJs`!

#### Usage

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)"]}>

```reason
[@bs.deriving {jsConverter: newType}]
type fruit =
  | Apple
  | [@bs.as 100] Kiwi
  | Watermelon;

let opaqueValue = fruitToJs(Apple);

[@bs.module "myJSFruits"] external jsKiwi : abs_fruit = "iSwearThisIsAKiwi";
let kiwi = fruitFromJs(jsKiwi);

let error = fruitFromJs(100); /* nope, can't take a random int */
```

```ocaml
type fruit =
  | Apple 
  | Kiwi [@bs.as 100]
  | Watermelon [@@bs.deriving { jsConverter = newType }]

let opaqueValue = fruitToJs Apple

external jsKiwi : abs_fruit = "iSwearThisIsAKiwi"[@@bs.module "myJSFruits"]

let kiwi = fruitFromJs jsKiwi
let error = fruitFromJs 100
```

</CodeTab>

## Generate Converters for JS String Enums and Polymorphic Variants

> **Note**: Since ReScript 8.2, polymorphic variants are already compiled to strings, so this feature is getting deprecated at some point. It's currently still useful for aliasing JS output with `@bs.as`.

Similarly as with [generating int converters](#generate-converters-between-js-integer-enums-and-variants), use `[@bs.deriving jsConverter]` on a polymorphic variant type to create converter functions for JS string and ReScript poly variant values.

### Usage

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)"]}>

```reason
[@bs.deriving jsConverter]
type fruit = [
  | `Apple
  | [@bs.as "miniCoconut"] `Kiwi
  | `Watermelon
];

let appleString = fruitToJs(`Apple); /* "Apple" */
let kiwiString = fruitToJs(`Kiwi); /* "miniCoconut" */
```

```ocaml
type fruit = [
  | `Apple 
  | `Kiwi [@bs.as "miniCoconut"]
  | `Watermelon
] [@@bs.deriving jsConverter]

let appleString = fruitToJs `Apple
let kiwiString = fruitToJs `Kiwi
```

</CodeTab>

You can also use `[@bs.deriving {jsConverter: newType}]` to generate abstract types instead.

## Convert Record Type to Abstract Record

> **Note**: For ReScript >= v7, we recommend using [plain records to compile to JS objects](bind-to-js-object#bind-to-record-like-js-objects). 
> This feature might still be useful for certain scenarios, but the ergonomics might be worse 

Use `[@bs.deriving abstract]` on a record type to expand the type into a creation, and a set of getter / setter functions for fields and methods.

Usually you'd just use ReScript records to compile to JS objects of the same shape. There is still one particular use-case left where the `[@bs.deriving abstract]` convertion is still useful: Whenever you need compile a record with an optional field where the JS object attribute shouldn't show up in the resulting JS when undefined (e.g. `{name: "Carl", age: undefined}` vs `{name: "Carl"}`). Check the [Optional Labels](#optional-labels) section for more infos on this particular scenario.

### Usage Example

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```reason
[@bs.deriving abstract]
type person = {
  name: string,
  age: int,
  job: string,
};

[@bs.val] external john : person = "john";
```

```ocaml
type person = {
  name: string;
  age: int;
  job: string;
} [@@bs.deriving abstract]

external john : person = "john" [@@bs.val]
```

</CodeTab>

**Note**: the `person` type is **not** a record! It's a record-looking type that uses the record's syntax and type-checking. The `[@bs.deriving abstract]` decorator turns it into an "abstract type" (aka you don't know what the actual value's shape).

### Creation

You don't have to bind to an existing `person` object from the JS side. You can also create such `person` JS object from ReScript's side.

Since `[@bs.deriving abstract]` turns the above `person` record into an abstract type, you can't directly create a person record as you would usually. This doesn't work: `{name: "Joe", age: 20, job: "teacher"}`.

Instead, you'd use the **creation function** of the same name as the record type, implicitly generated by the `[@bs.deriving abstract]` annotation:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```reason
let joe = person(~name="Joe", ~age=20, ~job="teacher")
```

```ocaml
let joe = person ~name:"Joe" ~age:20 ~job:"teacher"
```

```js
var joe = {
  name: "Joe",
  age: 20,
  job: "teacher"
};
```

</CodeTab>

Note how in the example above there is no JS runtime overhead.

#### Rename Fields

Sometimes you might be binding to a JS object with field names that are invalid in ReScript/Reason. Two examples would be `{type: "foo"}` (reserved keyword in ReScript/Reason) and `{"aria-checked": true}`. Choose a valid field name then use `[@bs.as]` to circumvent this:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```reason
[@bs.deriving abstract]
type data = {
  [@bs.as "type"] type_: string,
  [@bs.as "aria-label"] ariaLabel: string,
};

let d = data(~type_="message", ~ariaLabel="hello");
```

```ocaml
type data = {
  type_: string [@bs.as "type"];
  ariaLabel: string [@bs.as "aria-label"];
} [@@bs.deriving abstract]

let d = data ~type_:"message" ~ariaLabel:"hello"
```

```js
var d = {
  type: "message",
  "aria-label": "hello"
};
```

</CodeTab>

#### Optional Labels

You can omit fields during the creation of the object:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```reason
[@bs.deriving abstract]
type person = {
  [@bs.optional] name: string,
  age: int,
  job: string,
};

let joe = person(~age=20, ~job="teacher", ());
```

```ocaml
type person = {
  name: string [@bs.optional];
  age: int;
  job: string;
} [@@bs.deriving abstract]

let joe = person ~age:20 ~job:"teacher" ()
```

```js
var joe = {
  age: 20,
  job: "teacher"
};
```

</CodeTab>

Optional values that are not defined, will not show up as an attribute in the resulting JS object. In the example above, you will see that `name` was omitted.

**Note** that the `[@bs.optional]` tag turned the `name` field optional. Merely typing `name` as `option(string)` wouldn't work.

**Note**: now that your creation function contains optional fields, we mandate an unlabeled `()` at the end to indicate that [you've finished applying the function](function#optional-labeled-arguments).

### Accessors

Again, since `[@bs.deriving abstract]` hides the actual record shape, you can't access a field using e.g. `joe.age`. We remediate this by generating getter and setters.

#### Read

One getter function is generated per `bs.deriving abstract` record type field. In the above example, you'd get 3 functions: `nameGet`, `ageGet`, `jobGet`. They take in a `person` value and return `string`, `int`, `string` respectively:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```reason
let twenty = ageGet(joe)
```

```ocaml
let twenty = ageGet joe
```

</CodeTab>

Alternatively, you can use the [Pipe](pipe) operator (`->`) for a nicer-looking access syntax:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```reason
let twenty = joe->ageGet
```

```ocaml
let twenty = joe |. ageGet
```

</CodeTab>

If you prefer shorter names for the getter functions, we also support a `light` setting:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```reason
[@bs.deriving {abstract: light}]
type person = {
  name: string,
  age: int,
};

let joe = person(~name="Joe", ~age=20);
let joeName = name(joe);
```

```ocaml
type person = {
  name: string;
  age: int;
} [@@bs.deriving {abstract = light}]

let joe = person ~name:"Joe" ~age:20
let joeName = name joe
```

</CodeTab>

The getter functions will now have the same names as the object fields themselves.

#### Write

A `[@bs.deriving abstract]` value is immutable by default. To mutate such value, you need to first mark one of the abstract record field as `mutable`, the same way you'd mark a normal record as mutable:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```reason
[@bs.deriving abstract]
type person = {
  name: string,
  mutable age: int,
  job: string,
};
```

```ocaml
type person = {
  name: string;
  mutable age: int;
  job: string;
} [@@bs.deriving abstract]
```

</CodeTab>

Then, a setter of the name `ageSet` will be generated. Use it like so:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```reason
let joe = person(~name="Joe", ~age=20, ~job="teacher");
ageSet(joe, 21);
```

```ocaml
let joe = person ~name:"Joe" ~age:20 ~job:"teacher"
let () = ageSet joe 21
```

</CodeTab>

Alternatively, with the Pipe First syntax:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```reason
joe->ageSet(21)
```

```ocaml
joe |. ageSet 21
```

</CodeTab>

### Methods

You can attach arbitrary methods onto a type (_any_ type, as a matter of fact. Not just `[@bs.deriving abstract]` record types). See [Object Method](bind-to-js-function#object-method) in the "Bind to JS Function" section for more infos.

### Tips & Tricks

You can leverage `[@bs.deriving abstract]` for finer-grained access control.

#### Mutability

You can mark a field as mutable in the implementation (`ml`/`re`) file, while _hiding_ such mutability in the interface file:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```reason
/* test.re */
[@bs.deriving abstract]
type cord = {
  [@bs.optional] mutable x: int,
  y: int,
};
```

```ocaml
(* test.ml *)
type cord = {
  mutable x: int [@bs.optional];
  y: int;
} [@@bs.deriving abstract]
```

</CodeTab>

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```reason
/* test.rei */
[@bs.deriving abstract]
type cord = {
  [@bs.optional] x: int,
  y: int,
};
```

```ocaml
(* test.mli *)
type cord = {
  x: int [@bs.optional];
  y: int;
} [@@bs.deriving abstract]
```

</CodeTab>

Tada! Now you can mutate inside your own file as much as you want, and prevent others from doing so!

#### Hide the Creation Function

Mark the record as `private` to disable the creation function:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```reason
[@bs.deriving abstract]
type cord = pri {
  [@bs.optional] x: int,
  y: int,
};
```

```ocaml
type cord = private {
  x: int [@bs.optional];
  y: int
} [@@bs.deriving abstract]
```

</CodeTab>

The accessors are still there, but you can no longer create such data structure. Great for binding to a JS object while preventing others from creating more such object!

#### Use submodules to prevent naming collisions and binding shadowing

Oftentimes you will have multiple abstract types with similar attributes. Since
ReScript will expand all abstract getter, setter and creation functions in the
same scope where the type is defined, you will eventually run into value shadowing problems.

**For example:**

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```reason
[@bs.deriving abstract]
type person = {name: string};

[@bs.deriving abstract]
type cat = {
  name: string,
  isLazy: bool,
};

let person = person(~name="Alice");

/* Error: This expression has type person but an expression was expected
   of type cat */
person->nameGet();
```

```ocaml
type person = { name: string }[@@bs.deriving abstract]
type cat = {
  name: string;
  isLazy: bool
}[@@bs.deriving abstract]

let person = person ~name:"Alice";;

(person |. nameGet) ()
```

</CodeTab>

To get around this issue, you can use modules to group a type with its related
functions and later use them via local open statements:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```reason
module Person = {
  [@bs.deriving abstract]
  type t = {name: string};
};

module Cat = {
  [@bs.deriving abstract]
  type t = {
    name: string,
    isLazy: bool,
  };
};

let person = Person.t(~name="Alice");
let cat = Cat.t(~name="Snowball", ~isLazy=true);

/* We can use each nameGet function separately now */
let shoutPersonName = Person.(person->nameGet->Js.String.toUpperCase);

/* Note how we use a local open Cat.([some expression]) to 
   get access to Cat's nameGet function */
let whisperCatName = Cat.(cat->nameGet->Js.String.toLowerCase);
```

```ocaml
module Person =
  struct type t = { name: string }[@@bs.deriving abstract] end

module Cat = struct type t = {
  name: string;
  isLazy: bool
}[@@bs.deriving abstract] end

let person = Person.t ~name:"Alice"
let cat = Cat.t ~name:"Snowball" ~isLazy:true

let shoutPersonName =
  let open Person in (person |. nameGet) |. Js.String.toUpperCase

let whisperCatName =
  let open Cat in (cat |. nameGet) |. Js.String.toLowerCase
```

</CodeTab>

## Convert External into JS Object Creation Function

Use `@bs.obj` on an `external` binding to create a function that, when called, will evaluate to a `Js.t` object with fields corresponding to the function's parameter labels.

This is very handy because you can make some of those labelled parameters optional and if you don't pass them in, the output object won't include the corresponding fields. Thus you can use it to dynamically create objects with the subset of fields you need at runtime.

For example, suppose you need a JavaScript object like this:


```js
var homeRoute = {
  method: "GET",
  path: "/",
  action: () => console.log("Home"),
  // options: ...
};
```

But only the first three fields are required; the options field is optional. You can declare the binding function like so:


<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```reason
[@bs.obj] external route: (
  ~_method:string,
  ~path:string,
  ~action:(list(string) => unit),
  ~options:Js.t({..})=?,
  unit
) => _ = "";
```

```ocaml
external route :
  _method:string ->
  path:string ->
  action:(string list -> unit) ->
  ?options:< .. > Js.t ->
  unit ->
  _ = "" [@@bs.obj]
```

</CodeTab>

**Note**: the ` = ""` part at the end is just a dummy placeholder, due to syntactic limitations. It serves no purpose currently.

This function has four labelled parameters (the fourth one optional), one unlabelled parameter at the end (which we mandate for functions with [optional parameters](function#optional-labeled-arguments), and one parameter (`_method`) that requires an underscore prefix to avoid confusion with the ReScript keyword `method`.

Also of interest is the return type: `_`, which tells ReScript to automatically infer the full type of the `Js.t` object, sparing you the hassle of writing down the type manually!

The function is called like so:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```reason
let homeRoute = route(~_method="GET", ~path="/", ~action=(_ => Js.log("Home")), ());
```

```ocaml
let homeRoute = route ~_method:"GET" ~path:"/" ~action:(fun _ -> Js.log "Home") ()
```

</CodeTab>
