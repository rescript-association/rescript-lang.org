## Publishing ReScript Libraries / Bindings

### Via npm

Whenever you publish a ReScript package to npm, please follow the following guidelines:

**Naming:**
- Make sure to give a descriptive package name. We usually use `rescript-[name-of-js-lib]` for packages that bind to a specific JS library on npm.
- Use names that are self explanatory (no weird marketing terms / fantasy words if possible).

**Metadata:**
- Add a proper `description` field in your `package.json` file
- Add `rescript` as a keyword in your `package.json` file

Our package index will pick up the newest npm packages two times a day, so it might take some time until your newly published package shows up.

### Via rescript-lang.org

We also maintain a hand-curated index of different resources that are not necessarily released on npm, such as plain URLs to independent files / repositories, or GitHub gists.

You can submit your own resource by editing rescript-lang.org's [resource json file](https://github.com/reason-association/rescript-lang.org/blob/master/data/packages_url_resources.json) file and submit a PR.
