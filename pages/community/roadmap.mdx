# Roadmap

The ReScript development is an Open Source effort coordinated by individiual Open Source contributors, its creator [Hongbo Zhang](https://github.com/bobzhang) and members of the [ReScript Association](https://rescript-association.org).

For latest development updates, please check out the [ReScript forum](https://forum.rescript-lang.org) development section and the [ReScript blog](/blog), or follow the relevant GitHub milestones on the rescript-compiler repository.

## Current focus

Major v12.0 release (see [v12 milestone](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/milestone/16)).

* Move the [Rescript Core](https://github.com/rescript-association/rescript-core) standard library into the compiler / remove the OCaml standard library
* A new build system tailored to ReScript's needs ([rewatch](https://github.com/teamwalnut/rewatch)) for better monorepo support and even faster compilation speed
* Make it easier to create libraries for consumption from TypeScript with GenType

**Note:** Release goals may be subject to change.
