# Roadmap

*(Last update: June 2nd, 2022)*

This is a living document that defines our current roadmap, goals and ambitions.

All roadmap related discussions, proposals and changes can either be found in the [ReScript Forum](https://forum.rescript-lang.org), or in dedicated GitHub PRs / issues.

## v10 "First Community Release"

This is the first community-powered release. See the [May 2022 Meeting Notes](https://forum.rescript-lang.org/t/community-meeting-may-2022/3280) for more details.

**Estimated release date:** Mid 2022

### Notable changes
- Add M1 support
- Add support for unicode strings (e.g `"Hallöle"` will work like in JavaScript; see [PR](https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/pull/433))
- Add opt-in configuration flag `stdlib-future` to disable OCaml related stdlib code (for writing future proof code; see [discussion](https://forum.rescript-lang.org/t/roles-for-belt-js-and-pervasives-in-rescript/1683))
- (breaking) Remove OCaml’s Format module (should have no impact on the majority of ReScript users; see [discussion](https://forum.rescript-lang.org/t/what-stable-type-system-features-we-are-going-to-preserve-from-ocaml/1251))
- Convert stdlib files (`Js`, `Belt`, etc) to ReScript syntax ([tracking issue](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/issues/4872))


## Future

> **Important:** This list helps to set expectations, so it may change in the future.

- Make `bsconfig.json` json compliant ([Proposal](https://forum.rescript-lang.org/t/proposed-changes-make-bsconfig-json-standard-compilant/1859))
- Infix operator support (only for a dedicated set of math operators `+`, `-`, `-.`, `/`, `%`, etc.; see the [tracking issue](https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/issues/440))
- Docstring syntax support: `/** */` instead of `@ocaml.doc("My docstring")` ([tracking issue](https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/issues/439))
- Removal of the ocaml stdlib (removes globally accessible modules like `Array`, `List`, etc.)
- PPX only allowed on top level packages?
- Removal of recursive modules?
