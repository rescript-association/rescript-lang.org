# Roadmap

The ReScript development is an Open Source effort coordinated by individiual Open Source contributors, its creator [Hongbo Zhang](https://github.com/bobzhang) and members of the [ReScript Association](https://rescript-association.org).

For latest development updates, please check out the [ReScript forum](https://forum.rescript-lang.org) development section and the [ReScript blog](/blog), or follow the relevant GitHub milestones on the rescript-compiler repository.

## Current focus

Major v11.0 release (see [v11 milestone](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av11.0)).

- Uncurried functions
- Remove unnecessary Stdlib modules
- Explore better Belt / Js module alternative, tooling for markdown documentation generation, and more.

**Note:** Release goals may be subject of change.
