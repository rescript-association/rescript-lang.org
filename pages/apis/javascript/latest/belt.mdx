# Belt

The preferred standard library for Reason when targeting JavaScript
(browser, node, React Native).

It is recommended to use the modules from Belt rather than from the
OCaml standard library or from the [Js](/apis/javascript/latest/js) namespace, e.g. use
[Belt.List](/apis/javascript/latest/belt/list) instead of `List` or [Js.List](/apis/javascript/latest/js/list)
and [Belt.Array](/apis/javascript/latest/belt/array) instead of `Array` or [Js.Array](/apis/javascript/latest/js/array).

Belt is currently mostly covering collection types. It has no string or
date functions yet, although Belt.String is in the works. (In the meantime,
use [Js.String](/apis/javascript/latest/js/string) for string functions and [Js.Date](/apis/javascript/latest/js/date)
for date functions.)

## Motivation

Belt aims to improve the user experience for Reason developers targeting
JavaScript as well as for JavaScript developers learning Reason,
since the original OCaml standard library was not written with JS in mind.

To achieve this, Belt provides:

- A consistent naming convention familiar to JS developers ([camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case))
- A consistent argument order familiar to JS Developers (see [Pipe First](#Pipe%20First))
- Safety by default: A Belt function will never throw exceptions, unless it is
  indicated explicitly in the function name (suffix "Exn").
- Better performance and smaller code size running on the JS platform
- Ready for [Tree Shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/)

## Usage

To use modules from Belt, either refer to them by their fully qualified name
(`Belt.List`, `Belt.Array` etc.) or open the `Belt` module by putting

```
open Belt;
```

at the top of your source files. After opening Belt this way,
`Array` will refer to `Belt.Array`, `List` will refer to `Belt.List` etc.
in the source code below.

If you want to open Belt globally for all files in your project instead,
you can put

```
  "bsc-flags": [ "-open Belt" ],
```

into your `bsconfig.json`.

## Pipe First

The argument order of Belt functions follows the "Data-First" convention.
I.e. the object they act on (e.g. a list or an array) will always be
the first argument.

This way, the _pipe first operator_ `->` can be used nicely with the Belt APIs,
giving a similar feel to method invocations in OOP languages and allowing
easy chaining of Belt API calls.

For more information about the data-first argument order and the
trade-offs compared to data-last, see
[this blog post](https://www.javierchavarri.com/data-first-and-data-last-a-comparison/).

Example:

```
let someNumbers = [|1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 6, 3, 4, 2|];

let greaterThan2UniqueAndSorted =
  someNumbers
  ->Belt.Array.keep(x => x > 2)
  /* convert to and from set to make values unique */
  ->Belt.Set.Int.fromArray
  ->Belt.Set.Int.toArray; /* output is already sorted */

Js.log2("result", greaterThan2UniqueAndSorted);
```

## Curried vs. Uncurried Callbacks

For functions taking a callback parameter, there are usually two versions
available:

- curried (no suffix)
- uncurried (suffixed with `U`)

E.g.:

```
let forEach: (t('a), 'a => unit) => unit;

let forEachU: (t('a), (. 'a) => unit) => unit;
```

The uncurried version will be faster in some cases, but for simplicity we
recommend to stick with the curried version unless you know
what you are doing and really need the optimization.

The two versions can be invoked as follows:

```
["a", "b", "c"]->Belt.List.forEach(x => Js.log(x));

["a", "b", "c"]->Belt.List.forEachU((. x) => Js.log(x));
```

## Specialized Collections

For collections types like set or map, Belt provides both a generic module
as well as specialized, more efficient implementations for string and int keys.

For example, Belt has the following set modules:

- [Belt.Set](/apis/javascript/latest/belt/set)
- [Belt.Set.Int](/apis/javascript/latest/belt/set-int)
- [Belt.Set.String](/apis/javascript/latest/belt/set-string)

## Implementation Details

### A special encoding for collection safety

When we create a collection library for a custom data type we need a way to
provide a comparator function. Take Set for example, suppose its element type
is a pair of ints, it needs a custom compare function that takes two tuples and
returns their order. The Set could not just be typed as Set.t (int \* int) , its
customized compare function needs to manifest itself in the signature,
otherwise, if the user creates another customized compare function, the two
collection could mix which would result in runtime error.

The original OCaml stdlib solved the problem using functor which creates a big
closure at runtime and makes dead code elimination much harder. We use a
phantom type to solve the problem:

```
module Comparable1 =
  Belt.Id.MakeComparable(
    {
      type t = (int, int);
      let cmp = ((a0, a1), (b0, b1)) =>
        switch (Pervasives.compare(a0, b0)) {
        | 0 => Pervasives.compare(a1, b1)
        | c => c
        };
    }
  );

let mySet1 = Belt.Set.make(~id=(module Comparable1));

module Comparable2 =
  Belt.Id.MakeComparable(
    {
      type t = (int, int);
      let cmp = ((a0, a1), (b0, b1)) =>
        switch (Pervasives.compare(a0, b0)) {
        | 0 => Pervasives.compare(a1, b1)
        | c => c
        };
    }
  );

let mySet2 = Belt.Set.make(~id=(module Comparable2));
```

Here, the compiler would infer mySet1 and mySet2 having different type, so e.g.
a `merge` operation that tries to merge these two sets will correctly fail.

```
let mySet1: t((int, int), Comparable1.identity);
let mySet2: t((int, int), Comparable2.identity);
```

`Comparable1.identity` and `Comparable2.identity` are not the same using our
encoding scheme.
